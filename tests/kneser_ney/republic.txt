introduction and analysis
the republic of plato is the longest of his works with the exception of the laws and is certainly the greatest of them
there are nearer approaches to modern metaphysics in the philebus and in the sophist the politicus or statesman is more ideal the form and institutions of the state are more clearly drawn out in the laws as works of art the symposium and the protagoras are of higher excellence
but no other dialogue of plato has the same largeness of view and the same perfection of style no other shows an equal knowledge of the world or contains more of those thoughts which are new as well as old and not of one age only but of all
nowhere in plato is there a deeper irony or a greater wealth of humour or imagery or more dramatic power
nor in any other of his writings is the attempt made to interweave life and speculation or to connect politics with philosophy
the republic is the centre around which the other dialogues may be grouped here philosophy reaches the highest point to which ancient thinkers ever attained
plato among the greeks like bacon among the moderns was the first who conceived a method of knowledge although neither of them always distinguished the bare outline or form from the substance of truth and both of them had to be content with an abstraction of science which was not yet realized
he was the greatest metaphysical genius whom the world has seen and in him more than in any other ancient thinker the germs of future knowledge are contained
the sciences of logic and psychology which have supplied so many instruments of thought to after ages are based upon the analyses of socrates and plato
the principles of definition the law of contradiction the fallacy of arguing in a circle the distinction between the essence and accidents of a thing or notion between means and ends between causes and conditions also the division of the mind into the rational concupiscent and irascible elements or of pleasures and desires into necessary and unnecessary these and other great forms of thought are all of them to be found in the republic and were probably first invented by plato
the greatest of all logical truths and the one of which writers on philosophy are most apt to lose sight the difference between words and things has been most strenuously insisted on by him although he has not always avoided the confusion of them in his own writings 
but he does not bind up truth in logical formulae logic is still veiled in metaphysics and the science which he imagines to contemplate all truth and all existence is very unlike the doctrine of the syllogism which aristotle claims to have discovered 
neither must we forget that the republic is but the third part of a still larger design which was to have included an ideal history of athens as well as a political and physical philosophy
the fragment of the critias has given birth to a world famous fiction second only in importance to the tale of troy and the legend of arthur and is said as a fact to have inspired some of the early navigators of the sixteenth century
this mythical tale of which the subject was a history of the wars of the athenians against the island of atlantis is supposed to be founded upon an unfinished poem of solon to which it would have stood in the same relation as the writings of the logographers to the poems of homer
it would have told of a struggle for liberty intended to represent the conflict of persia and hellas
we may judge from the noble commencement of the timaeus from the fragment of the critias itself and from the third book of the laws in what manner plato would have treated this high argument
we can only guess why the great design was abandoned perhaps because plato became sensible of some incongruity in a fictitious history or because he had lost his interest in it or because advancing years forbade the completion of it and we may please ourselves with the fancy that had this imaginary narrative ever been finished we should have found plato himself sympathising with the struggle for hellenic independence singing a hymn of triumph over marathon and salamis perhaps making the reflection of herodotus where he contemplates the growth of the athenian empire how brave a thing is freedom of speech which has made the athenians so far exceed every other state of hellas in greatness
or more probably attributing the victory to the ancient good order of athens and to the favor of apollo and athene 
again plato may be regarded as the captain or leader of a goodly band of followers for in the republic is to be found the original of cicero s de republica of st
augustine s city of god of the utopia of sir thomas more and of the numerous other imaginary states which are framed upon the same model
the extent to which aristotle or the aristotelian school were indebted to him in the politics has been little recognised and the recognition is the more necessary because it is not made by aristotle himself
the two philosophers had more in common than they were conscious of and probably some elements of plato remain still undetected in aristotle
in english philosophy too many affinities may be traced not only in the works of the cambridge platonists but in great original writers like berkeley or coleridge to plato and his ideas
that there is a truth higher than experience of which the mind bears witness to herself is a conviction which in our own generation has been enthusiastically asserted and is perhaps gaining ground
of the greek authors who at the renaissance brought a new life into the world plato has had the greatest influence
the republic of plato is also the first treatise upon education of which the writings of milton and locke rousseau jean paul and goethe are the legitimate descendants
like dante or bunyan he has a revelation of another life like bacon he is profoundly impressed with the unity of knowledge in the early church he exercised a real influence on theology and at the revival of literature on politics
even the fragments of his words when repeated at second hand have in all ages ravished the hearts of men who have seen reflected in them their own higher nature
he is the father of idealism in philosophy in politics in literature
and many of the latest conceptions of modern thinkers and statesmen such as the unity of knowledge the reign of law and the equality of the sexes have been anticipated in a dream by him
the argument of the republic is the search after justice the nature of which is first hinted at by cephalus the just and blameless old man then discussed on the basis of proverbial morality by socrates and polemarchus then caricatured by thrasymachus and partially explained by socrates reduced to an abstraction by glaucon and adeimantus and having become invisible in the individual reappears at length in the ideal state which is constructed by socrates
the first care of the rulers is to be education of which an outline is drawn after the old hellenic model providing only for an improved religion and morality and more simplicity in music and gymnastic a manlier strain of poetry and greater harmony of the individual and the state
we are thus led on to the conception of a higher state in which no man calls anything his own and in which there is neither marrying nor giving in marriage and kings are philosophers and philosophers are kings and there is another and higher education intellectual as well as moral and religious of science as well as of art and not of youth only but of the whole of life
such a state is hardly to be realized in this world and quickly degenerates
to the perfect ideal succeeds the government of the soldier and the lover of honour this again declining into democracy and democracy into tyranny in an imaginary but regular order having not much resemblance to the actual facts
when the wheel has come full circle we do not begin again with a new period of human life but we have passed from the best to the worst and there we end
the subject is then changed and the old quarrel of poetry and philosophy which had been more lightly treated in the earlier books of the republic is now resumed and fought out to a conclusion
poetry is discovered to be an imitation thrice removed from the truth and homer as well as the dramatic poets having been condemned as an imitator is sent into banishment along with them
and the idea of the state is supplemented by the revelation of a future life
the division into books like all similar divisions is probably later than the age of plato
the natural divisions are five in number book i and the first half of book ii down to the paragraph beginning i had always admired the genius of glaucon and adeimantus which is introductory the first book containing a refutation of the popular and sophistical notions of justice and concluding like some of the earlier dialogues without arriving at any definite result
to this is appended a restatement of the nature of justice according to common opinion and an answer is demanded to the question what is justice stripped of appearances
the second division includes the remainder of the second and the whole of the third and fourth books which are mainly occupied with the construction of the first state and the first education
the third division consists of the fifth sixth and seventh books in which philosophy rather than justice is the subject of enquiry and the second state is constructed on principles of communism and ruled by philosophers and the contemplation of the idea of good takes the place of the social and political virtues
in the eighth and ninth books the perversions of states and of the individuals who correspond to them are reviewed in succession and the nature of pleasure and the principle of tyranny are further analysed in the individual man
the tenth book is the conclusion of the whole in which the relations of philosophy to poetry are finally determined and the happiness of the citizens in this life which has now been assured is crowned by the vision of another
or a more general division into two parts may be adopted the first containing the description of a state framed generally in accordance with hellenic notions of religion and morality while in the second the hellenic state is transformed into an ideal kingdom of philosophy of which all other governments are the perversions
these two points of view are really opposed and the opposition is only veiled by the genius of plato
the republic like the phaedrus is an imperfect whole the higher light of philosophy breaks through the regularity of the hellenic temple which at last fades away into the heavens
whether this imperfection of structure arises from an enlargement of the plan or from the imperfect reconcilement in the writer s own mind of the struggling elements of thought which are now first brought together by him or perhaps from the composition of the work at different times are questions like the similar question about the iliad and the odyssey which are worth asking but which cannot have a distinct answer
in the age of plato there was no regular mode of publication and an author would have the less scruple in altering or adding to a work which was known only to a few of his friends
there is no absurdity in supposing that he may have laid his labours aside for a time or turned from one work to another and such interruptions would be more likely to occur in the case of a long than of a short writing
in all attempts to determine the chronological order of the platonic writings on internal evidence this uncertainty about any single dialogue being composed at one time is a disturbing element which must be admitted to affect longer works such as the republic and the laws more than shorter ones
but on the other hand the seeming discrepancies of the republic may only arise out of the discordant elements which the philosopher has attempted to unite in a single whole perhaps without being himself able to recognise the inconsistency which is obvious to us
for there is a judgment of after ages which few great writers have ever been able to anticipate for themselves
they do not perceive the want of connexion in their own writings or the gaps in their systems which are visible enough to those who come after them
in the beginnings of literature and philosophy amid the first efforts of thought and language more inconsistencies occur than now when the paths of speculation are well worn and the meaning of words precisely defined
for consistency too is the growth of time and some of the greatest creations of the human mind have been wanting in unity
tried by this test several of the platonic dialogues according to our modern ideas appear to be defective but the deficiency is no proof that they were composed at different times or by different hands
and the supposition that the republic was written uninterruptedly and by a continuous effort is in some degree confirmed by the numerous references from one part of the work to another
the second title concerning justice is not the one by which the republic is quoted either by aristotle or generally in antiquity and like the other second titles of the platonic dialogues may therefore be assumed to be of later date
morgenstern and others have asked whether the definition of justice which is the professed aim or the construction of the state is the principal argument of the work
the answer is that the two blend in one and are two faces of the same truth for justice is the order of the state and the state is the visible embodiment of justice under the conditions of human society
the one is the soul and the other is the body and the greek ideal of the state as of the individual is a fair mind in a fair body
in hegelian phraseology the state is the reality of which justice is the idea
or described in christian language the kingdom of god is within and yet developes into a church or external kingdom the house not made with hands eternal in the heavens is reduced to the proportions of an earthly building
or to use a platonic image justice and the state are the warp and the woof which run through the whole texture
and when the constitution of the state is completed the conception of justice is not dismissed but reappears under the same or different names throughout the work both as the inner law of the individual soul and finally as the principle of rewards and punishments in another life
the virtues are based on justice of which common honesty in buying and selling is the shadow and justice is based on the idea of good which is the harmony of the world and is reflected both in the institutions of states and in motions of the heavenly bodies 
the timaeus which takes up the political rather than the ethical side of the republic and is chiefly occupied with hypotheses concerning the outward world yet contains many indications that the same law is supposed to reign over the state over nature and over man
too much however has been made of this question both in ancient and modern times
there is a stage of criticism in which all works whether of nature or of art are referred to design
now in ancient writings and indeed in literature generally there remains often a large element which was not comprehended in the original design
for the plan grows under the author s hand new thoughts occur to him in the act of writing he has not worked out the argument to the end before he begins
the reader who seeks to find some one idea under which the whole may be conceived must necessarily seize on the vaguest and most general
thus stallbaum who is dissatisfied with the ordinary explanations of the argument of the republic imagines himself to have found the true argument in the representation of human life in a state perfected by justice and governed according to the idea of good
there may be some use in such general descriptions but they can hardly be said to express the design of the writer
the truth is that we may as well speak of many designs as of one nor need anything be excluded from the plan of a great work to which the mind is naturally led by the association of ideas and which does not interfere with the general purpose
what kind or degree of unity is to be sought after in a building in the plastic arts in poetry in prose is a problem which has to be determined relatively to the subject matter
to plato himself the enquiry what was the intention of the writer or what was the principal argument of the republic would have been hardly intelligible and therefore had better be at once dismissed 
is not the republic the vehicle of three or four great truths which to plato s own mind are most naturally represented in the form of the state
just as in the jewish prophets the reign of messiah or the day of the lord or the suffering servant or people of god or the sun of righteousness with healing in his wings only convey to us at least their great spiritual ideals so through the greek state plato reveals to us his own thoughts about divine perfection which is the idea of good like the sun in the visible world about human perfection which is justice about education beginning in youth and continuing in later years about poets and sophists and tyrants who are the false teachers and evil rulers of mankind about the world which is the embodiment of them about a kingdom which exists nowhere upon earth but is laid up in heaven to be the pattern and rule of human life
no such inspired creation is at unity with itself any more than the clouds of heaven when the sun pierces through them
every shade of light and dark of truth and of fiction which is the veil of truth is allowable in a work of philosophical imagination
it is not all on the same plane it easily passes from ideas to myths and fancies from facts to figures of speech
it is not prose but poetry at least a great part of it and ought not to be judged by the rules of logic or the probabilities of history
the writer is not fashioning his ideas into an artistic whole they take possession of him and are too much for him
we have no need therefore to discuss whether a state such as plato has conceived is practicable or not or whether the outward form or the inward life came first into the mind of the writer
for the practicability of his ideas has nothing to do with their truth and the highest thoughts to which he attains may be truly said to bear the greatest marks of design justice more than the external frame work of the state the idea of good more than justice
the great science of dialectic or the organisation of ideas has no real content but is only a type of the method or spirit in which the higher knowledge is to be pursued by the spectator of all time and all existence
it is in the fifth sixth and seventh books that plato reaches the summit of speculation and these although they fail to satisfy the requirements of a modern thinker may therefore be regarded as the most important as they are also the most original portions of the work
it is not necessary to discuss at length a minor question which has been raised by boeckh respecting the imaginary date at which the conversation was held for a writer of fiction and especially a writer who like plato is notoriously careless of chronology only aims at general probability
whether all the persons mentioned in the republic could ever have met at any one time is not a difficulty which would have occurred to an athenian reading the work forty years later or to plato himself at the time of writing and need not greatly trouble us now
yet this may be a question having no answer which is still worth asking because the investigation shows that we cannot argue historically from the dates in plato it would be useless therefore to waste time in inventing far fetched reconcilements of them in order to avoid chronological difficulties such for example as the conjecture of c.f
hermann that glaucon and adeimantus are not the brothers but the uncles of plato or the fancy of stallbaum that plato intentionally left anachronisms indicating the dates at which some of his dialogues were written
the principal characters in the republic are cephalus polemarchus thrasymachus socrates glaucon and adeimantus
cephalus appears in the introduction only polemarchus drops at the end of the first argument and thrasymachus is reduced to silence at the close of the first book
the main discussion is carried on by socrates glaucon and adeimantus
among the company are lysias and euthydemus the sons of cephalus and brothers of polemarchus an unknown charmantides these are mute auditors also there is cleitophon who once interrupts where as in the dialogue which bears his name he appears as the friend and ally of thrasymachus
cephalus the patriarch of the house has been appropriately engaged in offering a sacrifice
he is the pattern of an old man who has almost done with life and is at peace with himself and with all mankind
he feels that he is drawing nearer to the world below and seems to linger around the memory of the past
he is eager that socrates should come to visit him fond of the poetry of the last generation happy in the consciousness of a well spent life glad at having escaped from the tyranny of youthful lusts
his love of conversation his affection his indifference to riches even his garrulity are interesting traits of character
he is not one of those who have nothing to say because their whole mind has been absorbed in making money
yet he acknowledges that riches have the advantage of placing men above the temptation to dishonesty or falsehood
the respectful attention shown to him by socrates whose love of conversation no less than the mission imposed upon him by the oracle leads him to ask questions of all men young and old alike should also be noted
who better suited to raise the question of justice than cephalus whose life might seem to be the expression of it
the moderation with which old age is pictured by cephalus as a very tolerable portion of existence is characteristic not only of him but of greek feeling generally and contrasts with the exaggeration of cicero in the de senectute
the evening of life is described by plato in the most expressive manner yet with the fewest possible touches
as cicero remarks the aged cephalus would have been out of place in the discussion which follows and which he could neither have understood nor taken part in without a violation of dramatic propriety 
his son and heir polemarchus has the frankness and impetuousness of youth he is for detaining socrates by force in the opening scene and will not let him off on the subject of women and children
like cephalus he is limited in his point of view and represents the proverbial stage of morality which has rules of life rather than principles and he quotes simonides as his father had quoted pindar
but after this he has no more to say the answers which he makes are only elicited from him by the dialectic of socrates
he has not yet experienced the influence of the sophists like glaucon and adeimantus nor is he sensible of the necessity of refuting them he belongs to the pre socratic or pre dialectical age
he is incapable of arguing and is bewildered by socrates to such a degree that he does not know what he is saying
he is made to admit that justice is a thief and that the virtues follow the analogy of the arts
from his brother lysias we learn that he fell a victim to the thirty tyrants but no allusion is here made to his fate nor to the circumstance that cephalus and his family were of syracusan origin and had migrated from thurii to athens
the chalcedonian giant thrasymachus of whom we have already heard in the phaedrus is the personification of the sophists according to plato s conception of them in some of their worst characteristics
he is vain and blustering refusing to discourse unless he is paid fond of making an oration and hoping thereby to escape the inevitable socrates but a mere child in argument and unable to foresee that the next move will shut him up
he has reached the stage of framing general notions and in this respect is in advance of cephalus and polemarchus
but he is incapable of defending them in a discussion and vainly tries to cover his confusion with banter and insolence
whether such doctrines as are attributed to him by plato were really held either by him or by any other sophist is uncertain in the infancy of philosophy serious errors about morality might easily grow up they are certainly put into the mouths of speakers in thucydides but we are concerned at present with plato s description of him and not with the historical reality
the inequality of the contest adds greatly to the humour of the scene
the pompous and empty sophist is utterly helpless in the hands of the great master of dialectic who knows how to touch all the springs of vanity and weakness in him
he is greatly irritated by the irony of socrates but his noisy and imbecile rage only lays him more and more open to the thrusts of his assailant
his determination to cram down their throats or put bodily into their souls his own words elicits a cry of horror from socrates
the state of his temper is quite as worthy of remark as the process of the argument
nothing is more amusing than his complete submission when he has been once thoroughly beaten
at first he seems to continue the discussion with reluctance but soon with apparent good will and he even testifies his interest at a later stage by one or two occasional remarks
when attacked by glaucon he is humorously protected by socrates as one who has never been his enemy and is now his friend
from cicero and quintilian and from aristotle s rhetoric we learn that the sophist whom plato has made so ridiculous was a man of note whose writings were preserved in later ages
the play on his name which was made by his contemporary herodicus thou wast ever bold in battle seems to show that the description of him is not devoid of verisimilitude
when thrasymachus has been silenced the two principal respondents glaucon and adeimantus appear on the scene here as in greek tragedy three actors are introduced
at first sight the two sons of ariston may seem to wear a family likeness like the two friends simmias and cebes in the phaedo
but on a nearer examination of them the similarity vanishes and they are seen to be distinct characters
glaucon is the impetuous youth who can just never have enough of fechting the man of pleasure who is acquainted with the mysteries of love the juvenis qui gaudet canibus and who improves the breed of animals the lover of art and music who has all the experiences of youthful life
he is full of quickness and penetration piercing easily below the clumsy platitudes of thrasymachus to the real difficulty he turns out to the light the seamy side of human life and yet does not lose faith in the just and true
it is glaucon who seizes what may be termed the ludicrous relation of the philosopher to the world to whom a state of simplicity is a city of pigs who is always prepared with a jest when the argument offers him an opportunity and who is ever ready to second the humour of socrates and to appreciate the ridiculous whether in the connoisseurs of music or in the lovers of theatricals or in the fantastic behaviour of the citizens of democracy
his weaknesses are several times alluded to by socrates who however will not allow him to be attacked by his brother adeimantus
he is a soldier and like adeimantus has been distinguished at the battle of megara .the character of adeimantus is deeper and graver and the profounder objections are commonly put into his mouth
glaucon is more demonstrative and generally opens the game
adeimantus pursues the argument further
glaucon has more of the liveliness and quick sympathy of youth adeimantus has the maturer judgment of a grown up man of the world
in the second book when glaucon insists that justice and injustice shall be considered without regard to their consequences adeimantus remarks that they are regarded by mankind in general only for the sake of their consequences and in a similar vein of reflection he urges at the beginning of the fourth book that socrates fails in making his citizens happy and is answered that happiness is not the first but the second thing not the direct aim but the indirect consequence of the good government of a state
in the discussion about religion and mythology adeimantus is the respondent but glaucon breaks in with a slight jest and carries on the conversation in a lighter tone about music and gymnastic to the end of the book
it is adeimantus again who volunteers the criticism of common sense on the socratic method of argument and who refuses to let socrates pass lightly over the question of women and children
it is adeimantus who is the respondent in the more argumentative as glaucon in the lighter and more imaginative portions of the dialogue
for example throughout the greater part of the sixth book the causes of the corruption of philosophy and the conception of the idea of good are discussed with adeimantus
glaucon resumes his place of principal respondent but he has a difficulty in apprehending the higher education of socrates and makes some false hits in the course of the discussion
once more adeimantus returns with the allusion to his brother glaucon whom he compares to the contentious state in the next book he is again superseded and glaucon continues to the end
thus in a succession of characters plato represents the successive stages of morality beginning with the athenian gentleman of the olden time who is followed by the practical man of that day regulating his life by proverbs and saws to him succeeds the wild generalization of the sophists and lastly come the young disciples of the great teacher who know the sophistical arguments but will not be convinced by them and desire to go deeper into the nature of things
these too like cephalus polemarchus thrasymachus are clearly distinguished from one another
neither in the republic nor in any other dialogue of plato is a single character repeated
the delineation of socrates in the republic is not wholly consistent
in the first book we have more of the real socrates such as he is depicted in the memorabilia of xenophon in the earliest dialogues of plato and in the apology
he is ironical provoking questioning the old enemy of the sophists ready to put on the mask of silenus as well as to argue seriously
but in the sixth book his enmity towards the sophists abates he acknowledges that they are the representatives rather than the corrupters of the world
he also becomes more dogmatic and constructive passing beyond the range either of the political or the speculative ideas of the real socrates
in one passage plato himself seems to intimate that the time had now come for socrates who had passed his whole life in philosophy to give his own opinion and not to be always repeating the notions of other men
there is no evidence that either the idea of good or the conception of a perfect state were comprehended in the socratic teaching though he certainly dwelt on the nature of the universal and of final causes and a deep thinker like him in his thirty or forty years of public teaching could hardly have failed to touch on the nature of family relations for which there is also some positive evidence in the memorabilia the socratic method is nominally retained and every inference is either put into the mouth of the respondent or represented as the common discovery of him and socrates
but any one can see that this is a mere form of which the affectation grows wearisome as the work advances
the method of enquiry has passed into a method of teaching in which by the help of interlocutors the same thesis is looked at from various points of view
the nature of the process is truly characterized by glaucon when he describes himself as a companion who is not good for much in an investigation but can see what he is shown and may perhaps give the answer to a question more fluently than another
neither can we be absolutely certain that socrates himself taught the immortality of the soul which is unknown to his disciple glaucon in the republic nor is there any reason to suppose that he used myths or revelations of another world as a vehicle of instruction or that he would have banished poetry or have denounced the greek mythology
his favorite oath is retained and a slight mention is made of the daemonium or internal sign which is alluded to by socrates as a phenomenon peculiar to himself
a real element of socratic teaching which is more prominent in the republic than in any of the other dialogues of plato is the use of example and illustration let us apply the test of common instances
you says adeimantus ironically in the sixth book are so unaccustomed to speak in images
and this use of examples or images though truly socratic in origin is enlarged by the genius of plato into the form of an allegory or parable which embodies in the concrete what has been already described or is about to be described in the abstract
thus the figure of the cave in book vii is a recapitulation of the divisions of knowledge in book vi
the composite animal in book ix is an allegory of the parts of the soul
the noble captain and the ship and the true pilot in book vi are a figure of the relation of the people to the philosophers in the state which has been described
other figures such as the dog or the marriage of the portionless maiden or the drones and wasps in the eighth and ninth books also form links of connexion in long passages or are used to recall previous discussions
plato is most true to the character of his master when he describes him as not of this world
and with this representation of him the ideal state and the other paradoxes of the republic are quite in accordance though they cannot be shown to have been speculations of socrates
to him as to other great teachers both philosophical and religious when they looked upward the world seemed to be the embodiment of error and evil
the common sense of mankind has revolted against this view or has only partially admitted it
and even in socrates himself the sterner judgement of the multitude at times passes into a sort of ironical pity or love
men in general are incapable of philosophy and are therefore at enmity with the philosopher but their misunderstanding of him is unavoidable for they have never seen him as he truly is in his own image they are only acquainted with artificial systems possessing no native force of truth words which admit of many applications
their leaders have nothing to measure with and are therefore ignorant of their own stature
but they are to be pitied or laughed at not to be quarrelled with they mean well with their nostrums if they could only learn that they are cutting off a hydra s head
this moderation towards those who are in error is one of the most characteristic features of socrates in the republic
in all the different representations of socrates whether of xenophon or plato and amid the differences of the earlier or later dialogues he always retains the character of the unwearied and disinterested seeker after truth without which he would have ceased to be socrates
leaving the characters we may now analyse the contents of the republic and then proceed to consider the general aspects of this hellenic ideal of the state the modern lights in which the thoughts of plato may be read
book i
the republic opens with a truly greek scene a festival in honour of the goddess bendis which is held in the piraeus to this is added the promise of an equestrian torch race in the evening
the whole work is supposed to be recited by socrates on the day after the festival to a small party consisting of critias timaeus hermocrates and another this we learn from the first words of the timaeus
when the rhetorical advantage of reciting the dialogue has been gained the attention is not distracted by any reference to the audience nor is the reader further reminded of the extraordinary length of the narrative
of the numerous company three only take any serious part in the discussion nor are we informed whether in the evening they went to the torch race or talked as in the symposium through the night
the manner in which the conversation has arisen is described as follows socrates and his companion glaucon are about to leave the festival when they are detained by a message from polemarchus who speedily appears accompanied by adeimantus the brother of glaucon and with playful violence compels them to remain promising them not only the torch race but the pleasure of conversation with the young which to socrates is a far greater attraction
they return to the house of cephalus polemarchus father now in extreme old age who is found sitting upon a cushioned seat crowned for a sacrifice
you should come to me oftener socrates for i am too old to go to you and at my time of life having lost other pleasures i care the more for conversation
socrates asks him what he thinks of age to which the old man replies that the sorrows and discontents of age are to be attributed to the tempers of men and that age is a time of peace in which the tyranny of the passions is no longer felt
yes replies socrates but the world will say cephalus that you are happy in old age because you are rich
and there is something in what they say socrates but not so much as they imagine as themistocles replied to the seriphian neither you if you had been an athenian nor i if i had been a seriphian would ever have been famous i might in like manner reply to you neither a good poor man can be happy in age nor yet a bad rich man
socrates remarks that cephalus appears not to care about riches a quality which he ascribes to his having inherited not acquired them and would like to know what he considers to be the chief advantage of them
cephalus answers that when you are old the belief in the world below grows upon you and then to have done justice and never to have been compelled to do injustice through poverty and never to have deceived anyone are felt to be unspeakable blessings
socrates who is evidently preparing for an argument next asks what is the meaning of the word justice
to tell the truth and pay your debts
no more than this
or must we admit exceptions
ought i for example to put back into the hands of my friend who has gone mad the sword which i borrowed of him when he was in his right mind
there must be exceptions
and yet says polemarchus the definition which has been given has the authority of simonides
here cephalus retires to look after the sacrifices and bequeaths as socrates facetiously remarks the possession of the argument to his heir polemarchus
the description of old age is finished and plato as his manner is has touched the key note of the whole work in asking for the definition of justice first suggesting the question which glaucon afterwards pursues respecting external goods and preparing for the concluding mythus of the world below in the slight allusion of cephalus
the portrait of the just man is a natural frontispiece or introduction to the long discourse which follows and may perhaps imply that in all our perplexity about the nature of justice there is no difficulty in discerning who is a just man
the first explanation has been supported by a saying of simonides and now socrates has a mind to show that the resolution of justice into two unconnected precepts which have no common principle fails to satisfy the demands of dialectic
.he proceeds what did simonides mean by this saying of his
did he mean that i was to give back arms to a madman
no not in that case not if the parties are friends and evil would result
he meant that you were to do what was proper good to friends and harm to enemies
every act does something to somebody and following this analogy socrates asks what is this due and proper thing which justice does and to whom
he is answered that justice does good to friends and harm to enemies
but in what way good or harm
in making alliances with the one and going to war with the other
then in time of peace what is the good of justice
the answer is that justice is of use in contracts and contracts are money partnerships
yes but how in such partnerships is the just man of more use than any other man
when you want to have money safely kept and not used
then justice will be useful when money is useless
and there is another difficulty justice like the art of war or any other art must be of opposites good at attack as well as at defence at stealing as well as at guarding
but then justice is a thief though a hero notwithstanding like autolycus the homeric hero who was excellent above all men in theft and perjury to such a pass have you and homer and simonides brought us though i do not forget that the thieving must be for the good of friends and the harm of enemies
and still there arises another question are friends to be interpreted as real or seeming enemies as real or seeming
and are our friends to be only the good and our enemies to be the evil
the answer is that we must do good to our seeming and real good friends and evil to our seeming and real evil enemies good to the good evil to the evil
but ought we to render evil for evil at all when to do so will only make men more evil
can justice produce injustice any more than the art of horsemanship can make bad horsemen or heat produce cold
the final conclusion is that no sage or poet ever said that the just return evil for evil this was a maxim of some rich and mighty man periander perdiccas or ismenias the theban 
thus the first stage of aphoristic or unconscious morality is shown to be inadequate to the wants of the age the authority of the poets is set aside and through the winding mazes of dialectic we make an approach to the christian precept of forgiveness of injuries
similar words are applied by the persian mystic poet to the divine being when the questioning spirit is stirred within him if because i do evil thou punishest me by evil what is the difference between thee and me
in this both plato and kheyam rise above the level of many christian theologians
the first definition of justice easily passes into the second for the simple words to speak the truth and pay your debts is substituted the more abstract to do good to your friends and harm to your enemies
either of these explanations gives a sufficient rule of life for plain men but they both fall short of the precision of philosophy
we may note in passing the antiquity of casuistry which not only arises out of the conflict of established principles in particular cases but also out of the effort to attain them and is prior as well as posterior to our fundamental notions of morality
the interrogation of moral ideas the appeal to the authority of homer the conclusion that the maxim do good to your friends and harm to your enemies being erroneous could not have been the word of any great man are all of them very characteristic of the platonic socrates
.here thrasymachus who has made several attempts to interrupt but has hitherto been kept in order by the company takes advantage of a pause and rushes into the arena beginning like a savage animal with a roar
socrates he says what folly is this
why do you agree to be vanquished by one another in a pretended argument
he then prohibits all the ordinary definitions of justice to which socrates replies that he cannot tell how many twelve is if he is forbidden to say 2 x 6 or 3 x 4 or 6 x 2 or 4 x 3
at first thrasymachus is reluctant to argue but at length with a promise of payment on the part of the company and of praise from socrates he is induced to open the game
listen he says my answer is that might is right justice the interest of the stronger now praise me
let me understand you first
do you mean that because polydamas the wrestler who is stronger than we are finds the eating of beef for his interest the eating of beef is also for our interest who are not so strong
thrasymachus is indignant at the illustration and in pompous words apparently intended to restore dignity to the argument he explains his meaning to be that the rulers make laws for their own interests
but suppose says socrates that the ruler or stronger makes a mistake then the interest of the stronger is not his interest
thrasymachus is saved from this speedy downfall by his disciple cleitophon who introduces the word thinks not the actual interest of the ruler but what he thinks or what seems to be his interest is justice
the contradiction is escaped by the unmeaning evasion for though his real and apparent interests may differ what the ruler thinks to be his interest will always remain what he thinks to be his interest
of course this was not the original assertion nor is the new interpretation accepted by thrasymachus himself
but socrates is not disposed to quarrel about words if as he significantly insinuates his adversary has changed his mind
in what follows thrasymachus does in fact withdraw his admission that the ruler may make a mistake for he affirms that the ruler as a ruler is infallible
socrates is quite ready to accept the new position which he equally turns against thrasymachus by the help of the analogy of the arts
every art or science has an interest but this interest is to be distinguished from the accidental interest of the artist and is only concerned with the good of the things or persons which come under the art
and justice has an interest which is the interest not of the ruler or judge but of those who come under his sway
thrasymachus is on the brink of the inevitable conclusion when he makes a bold diversion
tell me socrates he says have you a nurse
what a question
why do you ask
because if you have she neglects you and lets you go about drivelling and has not even taught you to know the shepherd from the sheep
for you fancy that shepherds and rulers never think of their own interest but only of their sheep or subjects whereas the truth is that they fatten them for their use sheep and subjects alike
and experience proves that in every relation of life the just man is the loser and the unjust the gainer especially where injustice is on the grand scale which is quite another thing from the petty rogueries of swindlers and burglars and robbers of temples
the language of men proves this our gracious and blessed tyrant and the like all which tends to show that justice is the interest of the stronger and that injustice is more profitable and also stronger than justice
thrasymachus who is better at a speech than at a close argument having deluged the company with words has a mind to escape
but the others will not let him go and socrates adds a humble but earnest request that he will not desert them at such a crisis of their fate
and what can i do more for you
he says would you have me put the words bodily into your souls
god forbid
replies socrates but we want you to be consistent in the use of terms and not to employ physician in an exact sense and then again shepherd or ruler in an inexact if the words are strictly taken the ruler and the shepherd look only to the good of their people or flocks and not to their own whereas you insist that rulers are solely actuated by love of office
no doubt about it replies thrasymachus
then why are they paid
is not the reason that their interest is not comprehended in their art and is therefore the concern of another art the art of pay which is common to the arts in general and therefore not identical with any one of them
nor would any man be a ruler unless he were induced by the hope of reward or the fear of punishment the reward is money or honour the punishment is the necessity of being ruled by a man worse than himself
and if a state were composed entirely of good men they would be affected by the last motive only and there would be as much nolo episcopari as there is at present of the opposite
the satire on existing governments is heightened by the simple and apparently incidental manner in which the last remark is introduced
there is a similar irony in the argument that the governors of mankind do not like being in office and that therefore they demand pay
.enough of this the other assertion of thrasymachus is far more important that the unjust life is more gainful than the just
now as you and i glaucon are not convinced by him we must reply to him but if we try to compare their respective gains we shall want a judge to decide for us we had better therefore proceed by making mutual admissions of the truth to one another
thrasymachus had asserted that perfect injustice was more gainful than perfect justice and after a little hesitation he is induced by socrates to admit the still greater paradox that injustice is virtue and justice vice
socrates praises his frankness and assumes the attitude of one whose only wish is to understand the meaning of his opponents
at the same time he is weaving a net in which thrasymachus is finally enclosed
the admission is elicited from him that the just man seeks to gain an advantage over the unjust only but not over the just while the unjust would gain an advantage over either
socrates in order to test this statement employs once more the favourite analogy of the arts
the musician doctor skilled artist of any sort does not seek to gain more than the skilled but only more than the unskilled whereas the unskilled makes random efforts at excess
thus the skilled falls on the side of the good and the unskilled on the side of the evil and the just is the skilled and the unjust is the unskilled
there was great difficulty in bringing thrasymachus to the point the day was hot and he was streaming with perspiration and for the first time in his life he was seen to blush
but his other thesis that injustice was stronger than justice has not yet been refuted and socrates now proceeds to the consideration of this which with the assistance of thrasymachus he hopes to clear up the latter is at first churlish but in the judicious hands of socrates is soon restored to good humour is there not honour among thieves
is not the strength of injustice only a remnant of justice
is not absolute injustice absolute weakness also
a house that is divided against itself cannot stand two men who quarrel detract from one another s strength and he who is at war with himself is the enemy of himself and the gods
not wickedness therefore but semi wickedness flourishes in states a remnant of good is needed in order to make union in action possible there is no kingdom of evil in this world
another question has not been answered is the just or the unjust the happier
to this we reply that every art has an end and an excellence or virtue by which the end is accomplished
and is not the end of the soul happiness and justice the excellence of the soul by which happiness is attained
justice and happiness being thus shown to be inseparable the question whether the just or the unjust is the happier has disappeared
thrasymachus replies let this be your entertainment socrates at the festival of bendis
yes and a very good entertainment with which your kindness has supplied me now that you have left off scolding
and yet not a good entertainment but that was my own fault for i tasted of too many things
first of all the nature of justice was the subject of our enquiry and then whether justice is virtue and wisdom or evil and folly and then the comparative advantages of just and unjust and the sum of all is that i know not what justice is how then shall i know whether the just is happy or not
thus the sophistical fabric has been demolished chiefly by appealing to the analogy of the arts
justice is like the arts in having no external interest and in not aiming at excess and justice is to happiness what the implement of the workman is to his work
at this the modern reader is apt to stumble because he forgets that plato is writing in an age when the arts and the virtues like the moral and intellectual faculties were still undistinguished
among early enquirers into the nature of human action the arts helped to fill up the void of speculation and at first the comparison of the arts and the virtues was not perceived by them to be fallacious
they only saw the points of agreement in them and not the points of difference
virtue like art must take means to an end good manners are both an art and a virtue character is naturally described under the image of a statue and there are many other figures of speech which are readily transferred from art to morals
the next generation cleared up these perplexities or at least supplied after ages with a further analysis of them
the contemporaries of plato were in a state of transition and had not yet fully realized the common sense distinction of aristotle that virtue is concerned with action art with production or that virtue implies intention and constancy of purpose whereas art requires knowledge only 
and yet in the absurdities which follow from some uses of the analogy there seems to be an intimation conveyed that virtue is more than art
this is implied in the reductio ad absurdum that justice is a thief and in the dissatisfaction which socrates expresses at the final result
the expression an art of pay which is described as common to all the arts is not in accordance with the ordinary use of language
nor is it employed elsewhere either by plato or by any other greek writer
it is suggested by the argument and seems to extend the conception of art to doing as well as making
another flaw or inaccuracy of language may be noted in the words men who are injured are made more unjust
for those who are injured are not necessarily made worse but only harmed or ill treated
the second of the three arguments that the just does not aim at excess has a real meaning though wrapped up in an enigmatical form
that the good is of the nature of the finite is a peculiarly hellenic sentiment which may be compared with the language of those modern writers who speak of virtue as fitness and of freedom as obedience to law
the mathematical or logical notion of limit easily passes into an ethical one and even finds a mythological expression in the conception of envy 
ideas of measure equality order unity proportion still linger in the writings of moralists and the true spirit of the fine arts is better conveyed by such terms than by superlatives
when workmen strive to do better than well they do confound their skill in covetousness
the harmony of the soul and body and of the parts of the soul with one another a harmony fairer than that of musical notes is the true hellenic mode of conceiving the perfection of human nature
in what may be called the epilogue of the discussion with thrasymachus plato argues that evil is not a principle of strength but of discord and dissolution just touching the question which has been often treated in modern times by theologians and philosophers of the negative nature of evil
in the last argument we trace the germ of the aristotelian doctrine of an end and a virtue directed towards the end which again is suggested by the arts
the final reconcilement of justice and happiness and the identity of the individual and the state are also intimated
socrates reassumes the character of a know nothing at the same time he appears to be not wholly satisfied with the manner in which the argument has been conducted
nothing is concluded but the tendency of the dialectical process here as always is to enlarge our conception of ideas and to widen their application to human life
book ii
thrasymachus is pacified but the intrepid glaucon insists on continuing the argument
he is not satisfied with the indirect manner in which at the end of the last book socrates had disposed of the question whether the just or the unjust is the happier
he begins by dividing goods into three classes first goods desirable in themselves secondly goods desirable in themselves and for their results thirdly goods desirable for their results only
he then asks socrates in which of the three classes he would place justice
in the second class replies socrates among goods desirable for themselves and also for their results
then the world in general are of another mind for they say that justice belongs to the troublesome class of goods which are desirable for their results only
socrates answers that this is the doctrine of thrasymachus which he rejects
glaucon thinks that thrasymachus was too ready to listen to the voice of the charmer and proposes to consider the nature of justice and injustice in themselves and apart from the results and rewards of them which the world is always dinning in his ears
he will first of all speak of the nature and origin of justice secondly of the manner in which men view justice as a necessity and not a good and thirdly he will prove the reasonableness of this view
to do injustice is said to be a good to suffer injustice an evil
as the evil is discovered by experience to be greater than the good the sufferers who cannot also be doers make a compact that they will have neither and this compact or mean is called justice but is really the impossibility of doing injustice
no one would observe such a compact if he were not obliged
let us suppose that the just and unjust have two rings like that of gyges in the well known story which make them invisible and then no difference will appear in them for every one will do evil if he can
and he who abstains will be regarded by the world as a fool for his pains
men may praise him in public out of fear for themselves but they will laugh at him in their hearts and now let us frame an ideal of the just and unjust
imagine the unjust man to be master of his craft seldom making mistakes and easily correcting them having gifts of money speech strength the greatest villain bearing the highest character and at his side let us place the just in his nobleness and simplicity being not seeming without name or reward clothed in his justice only the best of men who is thought to be the worst and let him die as he has lived
i might add that the just man will be scourged racked bound will have his eyes put out and will at last be crucified and all this because he ought to have preferred seeming to being
how different is the case of the unjust who clings to appearance as the true reality
his high character makes him a ruler he can marry where he likes trade where he likes help his friends and hurt his enemies having got rich by dishonesty he can worship the gods better and will therefore be more loved by them than the just
i was thinking what to answer when adeimantus joined in the already unequal fray
he considered that the most important point of all had been omitted men are taught to be just for the sake of rewards parents and guardians make reputation the incentive to virtue
and other advantages are promised by them of a more solid kind such as wealthy marriages and high offices
there are the pictures in homer and hesiod of fat sheep and heavy fleeces rich corn fields and trees toppling with fruit which the gods provide in this life for the just
and the orphic poets add a similar picture of another
the heroes of musaeus and eumolpus lie on couches at a festival with garlands on their heads enjoying as the meed of virtue a paradise of immortal drunkenness
some go further and speak of a fair posterity in the third and fourth generation
but the wicked they bury in a slough and make them carry water in a sieve and in this life they attribute to them the infamy which glaucon was assuming to be the lot of the just who are supposed to be unjust
take another kind of argument which is found both in poetry and prose virtue as hesiod says is honourable but difficult vice is easy and profitable
you may often see the wicked in great prosperity and the righteous afflicted by the will of heaven
and mendicant prophets knock at rich men s doors promising to atone for the sins of themselves or their fathers in an easy fashion with sacrifices and festive games or with charms and invocations to get rid of an enemy good or bad by divine help and at a small charge they appeal to books professing to be written by musaeus and orpheus and carry away the minds of whole cities and promise to get souls out of purgatory and if we refuse to listen to them no one knows what will happen to us
when a lively minded ingenuous youth hears all this what will be his conclusion
will he in the language of pindar make justice his high tower or fortify himself with crooked deceit
justice he reflects without the appearance of justice is misery and ruin injustice has the promise of a glorious life
appearance is master of truth and lord of happiness
to appearance then i will turn i will put on the show of virtue and trail behind me the fox of archilochus
i hear some one saying that wickedness is not easily concealed to which i reply that nothing great is easy
union and force and rhetoric will do much and if men say that they cannot prevail over the gods still how do we know that there are gods
only from the poets who acknowledge that they may be appeased by sacrifices
then why not sin and pay for indulgences out of your sin
for if the righteous are only unpunished still they have no further reward while the wicked may be unpunished and have the pleasure of sinning too
but what of the world below
nay says the argument there are atoning powers who will set that matter right as the poets who are the sons of the gods tell us and this is confirmed by the authority of the state
how can we resist such arguments in favour of injustice
add good manners and as the wise tell us we shall make the best of both worlds
who that is not a miserable caitiff will refrain from smiling at the praises of justice
even if a man knows the better part he will not be angry with others for he knows also that more than human virtue is needed to save a man and that he only praises justice who is incapable of injustice
the origin of the evil is that all men from the beginning heroes poets instructors of youth have always asserted the temporal dispensation the honours and profits of justice
had we been taught in early youth the power of justice and injustice inherent in the soul and unseen by any human or divine eye we should not have needed others to be our guardians but every one would have been the guardian of himself
this is what i want you to show socrates other men use arguments which rather tend to strengthen the position of thrasymachus that might is right but from you i expect better things
and please as glaucon said to exclude reputation let the just be thought unjust and the unjust just and do you still prove to us the superiority of justice 
the thesis which for the sake of argument has been maintained by glaucon is the converse of that of thrasymachus not right is the interest of the stronger but right is the necessity of the weaker
starting from the same premises he carries the analysis of society a step further back might is still right but the might is the weakness of the many combined against the strength of the few
there have been theories in modern as well as in ancient times which have a family likeness to the speculations of glaucon e.g
that power is the foundation of right or that a monarch has a divine right to govern well or ill or that virtue is self love or the love of power or that war is the natural state of man or that private vices are public benefits
all such theories have a kind of plausibility from their partial agreement with experience
for human nature oscillates between good and evil and the motives of actions and the origin of institutions may be explained to a certain extent on either hypothesis according to the character or point of view of a particular thinker
the obligation of maintaining authority under all circumstances and sometimes by rather questionable means is felt strongly and has become a sort of instinct among civilized men
the divine right of kings or more generally of governments is one of the forms under which this natural feeling is expressed
nor again is there any evil which has not some accompaniment of good or pleasure nor any good which is free from some alloy of evil nor any noble or generous thought which may not be attended by a shadow or the ghost of a shadow of self interest or of self love
we know that all human actions are imperfect but we do not therefore attribute them to the worse rather than to the better motive or principle
such a philosophy is both foolish and false like that opinion of the clever rogue who assumes all other men to be like himself
and theories of this sort do not represent the real nature of the state which is based on a vague sense of right gradually corrected and enlarged by custom and law any more than they describe the origin of society which is to be sought in the family and in the social and religious feelings of man
nor do they represent the average character of individuals which cannot be explained simply on a theory of evil but has always a counteracting element of good
and as men become better such theories appear more and more untruthful to them because they are more conscious of their own disinterestedness
a little experience may make a man a cynic a great deal will bring him back to a truer and kindlier view of the mixed nature of himself and his fellow men
the two brothers ask socrates to prove to them that the just is happy when they have taken from him all that in which happiness is ordinarily supposed to consist
not that there is any absurdity in the attempt to frame a notion of justice apart from circumstances
for the ideal must always be a paradox when compared with the ordinary conditions of human life
neither the stoical ideal nor the christian ideal is true as a fact but they may serve as a basis of education and may exercise an ennobling influence
an ideal is none the worse because some one has made the discovery that no such ideal was ever realized
and in a few exceptional individuals who are raised above the ordinary level of humanity the ideal of happiness may be realized in death and misery
this may be the state which the reason deliberately approves and which the utilitarian as well as every other moralist may be bound in certain cases to prefer
nor again must we forget that plato though he agrees generally with the view implied in the argument of the two brothers is not expressing his own final conclusion but rather seeking to dramatize one of the aspects of ethical truth
he is developing his idea gradually in a series of positions or situations
he is exhibiting socrates for the first time undergoing the socratic interrogation
lastly the word happiness involves some degree of confusion because associated in the language of modern philosophy with conscious pleasure or satisfaction which was not equally present to his mind
glaucon has been drawing a picture of the misery of the just and the happiness of the unjust to which the misery of the tyrant in book ix is the answer and parallel
and still the unjust must appear just that is the homage which vice pays to virtue
but now adeimantus taking up the hint which had been already given by glaucon proceeds to show that in the opinion of mankind justice is regarded only for the sake of rewards and reputation and points out the advantage which is given to such arguments as those of thrasymachus and glaucon by the conventional morality of mankind
he seems to feel the difficulty of justifying the ways of god to man
both the brothers touch upon the question whether the morality of actions is determined by their consequences and both of them go beyond the position of socrates that justice belongs to the class of goods not desirable for themselves only but desirable for themselves and for their results to which he recalls them
in their attempt to view justice as an internal principle and in their condemnation of the poets they anticipate him
the common life of greece is not enough for them they must penetrate deeper into the nature of things
it has been objected that justice is honesty in the sense of glaucon and adeimantus but is taken by socrates to mean all virtue
may we not more truly say that the old fashioned notion of justice is enlarged by socrates and becomes equivalent to universal order or well being first in the state and secondly in the individual
he has found a new answer to his old question whether the virtues are one or many viz
that one is the ordering principle of the three others
in seeking to establish the purely internal nature of justice he is met by the fact that man is a social being and he tries to harmonise the two opposite theses as well as he can
there is no more inconsistency in this than was inevitable in his age and country there is no use in turning upon him the cross lights of modern philosophy which from some other point of view would appear equally inconsistent
plato does not give the final solution of philosophical questions for us nor can he be judged of by our standard
the remainder of the republic is developed out of the question of the sons of ariston
three points are deserving of remark in what immediately follows first that the answer of socrates is altogether indirect
he does not say that happiness consists in the contemplation of the idea of justice and still less will he be tempted to affirm the stoical paradox that the just man can be happy on the rack
but first he dwells on the difficulty of the problem and insists on restoring man to his natural condition before he will answer the question at all
he too will frame an ideal but his ideal comprehends not only abstract justice but the whole relations of man
under the fanciful illustration of the large letters he implies that he will only look for justice in society and that from the state he will proceed to the individual
his answer in substance amounts to this that under favourable conditions i.e
in the perfect state justice and happiness will coincide and that when justice has been once found happiness may be left to take care of itself
that he falls into some degree of inconsistency when in the tenth book he claims to have got rid of the rewards and honours of justice may be admitted for he has left those which exist in the perfect state
and the philosopher who retires under the shelter of a wall can hardly have been esteemed happy by him at least not in this world
still he maintains the true attitude of moral action
let a man do his duty first without asking whether he will be happy or not and happiness will be the inseparable accident which attends him
seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you
secondly it may be remarked that plato preserves the genuine character of greek thought in beginning with the state and in going on to the individual
first ethics then politics this is the order of ideas to us the reverse is the order of history
only after many struggles of thought does the individual assert his right as a moral being
in early ages he is not one but one of many the citizen of a state which is prior to him and he has no notion of good or evil apart from the law of his country or the creed of his church
and to this type he is constantly tending to revert whenever the influence of custom or of party spirit or the recollection of the past becomes too strong for him
thirdly we may observe the confusion or identification of the individual and the state of ethics and politics which pervades early greek speculation and even in modern times retains a certain degree of influence
the subtle difference between the collective and individual action of mankind seems to have escaped early thinkers and we too are sometimes in danger of forgetting the conditions of united human action whenever we either elevate politics into ethics or lower ethics to the standard of politics
the good man and the good citizen only coincide in the perfect state and this perfection cannot be attained by legislation acting upon them from without but if at all by education fashioning them from within
.socrates praises the sons of ariston inspired offspring of the renowned hero as the elegiac poet terms them but he does not understand how they can argue so eloquently on behalf of injustice while their character shows that they are uninfluenced by their own arguments
he knows not how to answer them although he is afraid of deserting justice in the hour of need
he therefore makes a condition that having weak eyes he shall be allowed to read the large letters first and then go on to the smaller that is he must look for justice in the state first and will then proceed to the individual
accordingly he begins to construct the state
society arises out of the wants of man
his first want is food his second a house his third a coat
the sense of these needs and the possibility of satisfying them by exchange draw individuals together on the same spot and this is the beginning of a state which we take the liberty to invent although necessity is the real inventor
there must be first a husbandman secondly a builder thirdly a weaver to which may be added a cobbler
four or five citizens at least are required to make a city
now men have different natures and one man will do one thing better than many and business waits for no man
hence there must be a division of labour into different employments into wholesale and retail trade into workers and makers of workmen s tools into shepherds and husbandmen
a city which includes all this will have far exceeded the limit of four or five and yet not be very large
but then again imports will be required and imports necessitate exports and this implies variety of produce in order to attract the taste of purchasers also merchants and ships
in the city too we must have a market and money and retail trades otherwise buyers and sellers will never meet and the valuable time of the producers will be wasted in vain efforts at exchange
if we add hired servants the state will be complete
and we may guess that somewhere in the intercourse of the citizens with one another justice and injustice will appear
here follows a rustic picture of their way of life
they spend their days in houses which they have built for themselves they make their own clothes and produce their own corn and wine
their principal food is meal and flour and they drink in moderation
they live on the best of terms with each other and take care not to have too many children
but said glaucon interposing are they not to have a relish
certainly they will have salt and olives and cheese vegetables and fruits and chestnuts to roast at the fire
tis a city of pigs socrates
why i replied what do you want more
only the comforts of life sofas and tables also sauces and sweets
i see you want not only a state but a luxurious state and possibly in the more complex frame we may sooner find justice and injustice
then the fine arts must go to work every conceivable instrument and ornament of luxury will be wanted
there will be dancers painters sculptors musicians cooks barbers tire women nurses artists swineherds and neatherds too for the animals and physicians to cure the disorders of which luxury is the source
to feed all these superfluous mouths we shall need a part of our neighbour s land and they will want a part of ours
and this is the origin of war which may be traced to the same causes as other political evils
our city will now require the slight addition of a camp and the citizen will be converted into a soldier
but then again our old doctrine of the division of labour must not be forgotten
the art of war cannot be learned in a day and there must be a natural aptitude for military duties
there will be some warlike natures who have this aptitude dogs keen of scent swift of foot to pursue and strong of limb to fight
and as spirit is the foundation of courage such natures whether of men or animals will be full of spirit
but these spirited natures are apt to bite and devour one another the union of gentleness to friends and fierceness against enemies appears to be an impossibility and the guardian of a state requires both qualities
who then can be a guardian
the image of the dog suggests an answer
for dogs are gentle to friends and fierce to strangers
your dog is a philosopher who judges by the rule of knowing or not knowing and philosophy whether in man or beast is the parent of gentleness
the human watchdogs must be philosophers or lovers of learning which will make them gentle
and how are they to be learned without education
but what shall their education be
is any better than the old fashioned sort which is comprehended under the name of music and gymnastic
music includes literature and literature is of two kinds true and false
what do you mean
he said
i mean that children hear stories before they learn gymnastics and that the stories are either untrue or have at most one or two grains of truth in a bushel of falsehood
now early life is very impressible and children ought not to learn what they will have to unlearn when they grow up we must therefore have a censorship of nursery tales banishing some and keeping others
some of them are very improper as we may see in the great instances of homer and hesiod who not only tell lies but bad lies stories about uranus and saturn which are immoral as well as false and which should never be spoken of to young persons or indeed at all or if at all then in a mystery after the sacrifice not of an eleusinian pig but of some unprocurable animal
shall our youth be encouraged to beat their fathers by the example of zeus or our citizens be incited to quarrel by hearing or seeing representations of strife among the gods
shall they listen to the narrative of hephaestus binding his mother and of zeus sending him flying for helping her when she was beaten
such tales may possibly have a mystical interpretation but the young are incapable of understanding allegory
if any one asks what tales are to be allowed we will answer that we are legislators and not book makers we only lay down the principles according to which books are to be written to write them is the duty of others
and our first principle is that god must be represented as he is not as the author of all things but of good only
we will not suffer the poets to say that he is the steward of good and evil or that he has two casks full of destinies or that athene and zeus incited pandarus to break the treaty or that god caused the sufferings of niobe or of pelops or the trojan war or that he makes men sin when he wishes to destroy them
either these were not the actions of the gods or god was just and men were the better for being punished
but that the deed was evil and god the author is a wicked suicidal fiction which we will allow no one old or young to utter
this is our first and great principle god is the author of good only
and the second principle is like unto it with god is no variableness or change of form
reason teaches us this for if we suppose a change in god he must be changed either by another or by himself
by another
but the best works of nature and art and the noblest qualities of mind are least liable to be changed by any external force
by himself
but he cannot change for the better he will hardly change for the worse
he remains for ever fairest and best in his own image
therefore we refuse to listen to the poets who tell us of here begging in the likeness of a priestess or of other deities who prowl about at night in strange disguises all that blasphemous nonsense with which mothers fool the manhood out of their children must be suppressed
but some one will say that god who is himself unchangeable may take a form in relation to us
why should he
for gods as well as men hate the lie in the soul or principle of falsehood and as for any other form of lying which is used for a purpose and is regarded as innocent in certain exceptional cases what need have the gods of this
for they are not ignorant of antiquity like the poets nor are they afraid of their enemies nor is any madman a friend of theirs
god then is true he is absolutely true he changes not he deceives not by day or night by word or sign
this is our second great principle god is true
away with the lying dream of agamemnon in homer and the accusation of thetis against apollo in aeschylus
in order to give clearness to his conception of the state plato proceeds to trace the first principles of mutual need and of division of labour in an imaginary community of four or five citizens
gradually this community increases the division of labour extends to countries imports necessitate exports a medium of exchange is required and retailers sit in the market place to save the time of the producers
these are the steps by which plato constructs the first or primitive state introducing the elements of political economy by the way
as he is going to frame a second or civilized state the simple naturally comes before the complex
he indulges like rousseau in a picture of primitive life an idea which has indeed often had a powerful influence on the imagination of mankind but he does not seriously mean to say that one is better than the other nor can any inference be drawn from the description of the first state taken apart from the second such as aristotle appears to draw in the politics
we should not interpret a platonic dialogue any more than a poem or a parable in too literal or matter of fact a style
on the other hand when we compare the lively fancy of plato with the dried up abstractions of modern treatises on philosophy we are compelled to say with protagoras that the mythus is more interesting several interesting remarks which in modern times would have a place in a treatise on political economy are scattered up and down the writings of plato especially laws population free trade adulteration wills and bequests begging eryxias value and demand republic division of labour
the last subject and also the origin of retail trade is treated with admirable lucidity in the second book of the republic
but plato never combined his economic ideas into a system and never seems to have recognized that trade is one of the great motive powers of the state and of the world
he would make retail traders only of the inferior sort of citizens though he remarks quaintly enough that if only the best men and the best women everywhere were compelled to keep taverns for a time or to carry on retail trade etc
then we should knew how pleasant and agreeable all these things are
the disappointment of glaucon at the city of pigs the ludicrous description of the ministers of luxury in the more refined state and the afterthought of the necessity of doctors the illustration of the nature of the guardian taken from the dog the desirableness of offering some almost unprocurable victim when impure mysteries are to be celebrated the behaviour of zeus to his father and of hephaestus to his mother are touches of humour which have also a serious meaning
in speaking of education plato rather startles us by affirming that a child must be trained in falsehood first and in truth afterwards
yet this is not very different from saying that children must be taught through the medium of imagination as well as reason that their minds can only develope gradually and that there is much which they must learn without understanding
this is also the substance of plato s view though he must be acknowledged to have drawn the line somewhat differently from modern ethical writers respecting truth and falsehood
to us economies or accommodations would not be allowable unless they were required by the human faculties or necessary for the communication of knowledge to the simple and ignorant
we should insist that the word was inseparable from the intention and that we must not be falsely true i.e
speak or act falsely in support of what was right or true
but plato would limit the use of fictions only by requiring that they should have a good moral effect and that such a dangerous weapon as falsehood should be employed by the rulers alone and for great objects
a greek in the age of plato attached no importance to the question whether his religion was an historical fact
he was just beginning to be conscious that the past had a history but he could see nothing beyond homer and hesiod
whether their narratives were true or false did not seriously affect the political or social life of hellas
men only began to suspect that they were fictions when they recognised them to be immoral
and so in all religions the consideration of their morality comes first afterwards the truth of the documents in which they are recorded or of the events natural or supernatural which are told of them
but in modern times and in protestant countries perhaps more than in catholic we have been too much inclined to identify the historical with the moral and some have refused to believe in religion at all unless a superhuman accuracy was discernible in every part of the record
the facts of an ancient or religious history are amongst the most important of all facts but they are frequently uncertain and we only learn the true lesson which is to be gathered from them when we place ourselves above them
these reflections tend to show that the difference between plato and ourselves though not unimportant is not so great as might at first sight appear
for we should agree with him in placing the moral before the historical truth of religion and generally in disregarding those errors or misstatements of fact which necessarily occur in the early stages of all religions
we know also that changes in the traditions of a country cannot be made in a day and are therefore tolerant of many things which science and criticism would condemn
we note in passing that the allegorical interpretation of mythology said to have been first introduced as early as the sixth century before christ by theagenes of rhegium was well established in the age of plato and here as in the phaedrus though for a different reason was rejected by him
that anachronisms whether of religion or law when men have reached another stage of civilization should be got rid of by fictions is in accordance with universal experience
great is the art of interpretation and by a natural process which when once discovered was always going on what could not be altered was explained away
and so without any palpable inconsistency there existed side by side two forms of religion the tradition inherited or invented by the poets and the customary worship of the temple on the other hand there was the religion of the philosopher who was dwelling in the heaven of ideas but did not therefore refuse to offer a cock to aesculapius or to be seen saying his prayers at the rising of the sun
at length the antagonism between the popular and philosophical religion never so great among the greeks as in our own age disappeared and was only felt like the difference between the religion of the educated and uneducated among ourselves
the zeus of homer and hesiod easily passed into the royal mind of plato the giant heracles became the knight errant and benefactor of mankind
these and still more wonderful transformations were readily effected by the ingenuity of stoics and neo platonists in the two or three centuries before and after christ
the greek and roman religions were gradually permeated by the spirit of philosophy having lost their ancient meaning they were resolved into poetry and morality and probably were never purer than at the time of their decay when their influence over the world was waning
a singular conception which occurs towards the end of the book is the lie in the soul this is connected with the platonic and socratic doctrine that involuntary ignorance is worse than voluntary
the lie in the soul is a true lie the corruption of the highest truth the deception of the highest part of the soul from which he who is deceived has no power of delivering himself
for example to represent god as false or immoral or according to plato as deluding men with appearances or as the author of evil or again to affirm with protagoras that knowledge is sensation or that being is becoming or with thrasymachus that might is right would have been regarded by plato as a lie of this hateful sort
the greatest unconsciousness of the greatest untruth e.g
if in the language of the gospels he who was blind were to say i see is another aspect of the state of mind which plato is describing
the lie in the soul may be further compared with the sin against the holy ghost allowing for the difference between greek and christian modes of speaking
to this is opposed the lie in words which is only such a deception as may occur in a play or poem or allegory or figure of speech or in any sort of accommodation which though useless to the gods may be useful to men in certain cases
socrates is here answering the question which he had himself raised about the propriety of deceiving a madman and he is also contrasting the nature of god and man
for god is truth but mankind can only be true by appearing sometimes to be partial or false
reserving for another place the greater questions of religion or education we may note further the approval of the old traditional education of greece the preparation which plato is making for the attack on homer and the poets the preparation which he is also making for the use of economies in the state the contemptuous and at the same time euphemistic manner in which here as below he alludes to the chronique scandaleuse of the gods
book iii
there is another motive in purifying religion which is to banish fear for no man can be courageous who is afraid of death or who believes the tales which are repeated by the poets concerning the world below
they must be gently requested not to abuse hell they may be reminded that their stories are both untrue and discouraging
nor must they be angry if we expunge obnoxious passages such as the depressing words of achilles i would rather be a serving man than rule over all the dead and the verses which tell of the squalid mansions the senseless shadows the flitting soul mourning over lost strength and youth the soul with a gibber going beneath the earth like smoke or the souls of the suitors which flutter about like bats
the terrors and horrors of cocytus and styx ghosts and sapless shades and the rest of their tartarean nomenclature must vanish
such tales may have their use but they are not the proper food for soldiers
as little can we admit the sorrows and sympathies of the homeric heroes achilles the son of thetis in tears throwing ashes on his head or pacing up and down the sea shore in distraction or priam the cousin of the gods crying aloud rolling in the mire
a good man is not prostrated at the loss of children or fortune
neither is death terrible to him and therefore lamentations over the dead should not be practised by men of note they should be the concern of inferior persons only whether women or men
still worse is the attribution of such weakness to the gods as when the goddesses say alas
my travail
and worst of all when the king of heaven himself laments his inability to save hector or sorrows over the impending doom of his dear sarpedon
such a character of god if not ridiculed by our young men is likely to be imitated by them
nor should our citizens be given to excess of laughter such violent delights are followed by a violent re action
the description in the iliad of the gods shaking their sides at the clumsiness of hephaestus will not be admitted by us
certainly not
truth should have a high place among the virtues for falsehood as we were saying is useless to the gods and only useful to men as a medicine
but this employment of falsehood must remain a privilege of state the common man must not in return tell a lie to the ruler any more than the patient would tell a lie to his physician or the sailor to his captain
in the next place our youth must be temperate and temperance consists in self control and obedience to authority
that is a lesson which homer teaches in some places the achaeans marched on breathing prowess in silent awe of their leaders but a very different one in other places o heavy with wine who hast the eyes of a dog but the heart of a stag
language of the latter kind will not impress self control on the minds of youth
the same may be said about his praises of eating and drinking and his dread of starvation also about the verses in which he tells of the rapturous loves of zeus and here or of how hephaestus once detained ares and aphrodite in a net on a similar occasion
there is a nobler strain heard in the words endure my soul thou hast endured worse
nor must we allow our citizens to receive bribes or to say gifts persuade the gods gifts reverend kings or to applaud the ignoble advice of phoenix to achilles that he should get money out of the greeks before he assisted them or the meanness of achilles himself in taking gifts from agamemnon or his requiring a ransom for the body of hector or his cursing of apollo or his insolence to the river god scamander or his dedication to the dead patroclus of his own hair which had been already dedicated to the other river god spercheius or his cruelty in dragging the body of hector round the walls and slaying the captives at the pyre such a combination of meanness and cruelty in cheiron s pupil is inconceivable
the amatory exploits of peirithous and theseus are equally unworthy
either these so called sons of gods were not the sons of gods or they were not such as the poets imagine them any more than the gods themselves are the authors of evil
the youth who believes that such things are done by those who have the blood of heaven flowing in their veins will be too ready to imitate their example
enough of gods and heroes what shall we say about men
what the poets and story tellers say that the wicked prosper and the righteous are afflicted or that justice is another s gain
such misrepresentations cannot be allowed by us
but in this we are anticipating the definition of justice and had therefore better defer the enquiry
the subjects of poetry have been sufficiently treated next follows style
now all poetry is a narrative of events past present or to come and narrative is of three kinds the simple the imitative and a composition of the two
an instance will make my meaning clear
the first scene in homer is of the last or mixed kind being partly description and partly dialogue
but if you throw the dialogue into the oratio obliqua the passage will run thus the priest came and prayed apollo that the achaeans might take troy and have a safe return if agamemnon would only give him back his daughter and the other greeks assented but agamemnon was wroth and so on the whole then becomes descriptive and the poet is the only speaker left or if you omit the narrative the whole becomes dialogue
these are the three styles which of them is to be admitted into our state
do you ask whether tragedy and comedy are to be admitted
yes but also something more is it not doubtful whether our guardians are to be imitators at all
or rather has not the question been already answered for we have decided that one man cannot in his life play many parts any more than he can act both tragedy and comedy or be rhapsodist and actor at once
human nature is coined into very small pieces and as our guardians have their own business already which is the care of freedom they will have enough to do without imitating
if they imitate they should imitate not any meanness or baseness but the good only for the mask which the actor wears is apt to become his face
we cannot allow men to play the parts of women quarrelling weeping scolding or boasting against the gods least of all when making love or in labour
they must not represent slaves or bullies or cowards drunkards or madmen or blacksmiths or neighing horses or bellowing bulls or sounding rivers or a raging sea
a good or wise man will be willing to perform good and wise actions but he will be ashamed to play an inferior part which he has never practised and he will prefer to employ the descriptive style with as little imitation as possible
the man who has no self respect on the contrary will imitate anybody and anything sounds of nature and cries of animals alike his whole performance will be imitation of gesture and voice
now in the descriptive style there are few changes but in the dramatic there are a great many
poets and musicians use either or a compound of both and this compound is very attractive to youth and their teachers as well as to the vulgar
but our state in which one man plays one part only is not adapted for complexity
and when one of these polyphonous pantomimic gentlemen offers to exhibit himself and his poetry we will show him every observance of respect but at the same time tell him that there is no room for his kind in our state we prefer the rough honest poet and will not depart from our original models 
next as to the music
a song or ode has three parts the subject the harmony and the rhythm of which the two last are dependent upon the first
as we banished strains of lamentation so we may now banish the mixed lydian harmonies which are the harmonies of lamentation and as our citizens are to be temperate we may also banish convivial harmonies such as the ionian and pure lydian
two remain the dorian and phrygian the first for war the second for peace the one expressive of courage the other of obedience or instruction or religious feeling
and as we reject varieties of harmony we shall also reject the many stringed variously shaped instruments which give utterance to them and in particular the flute which is more complex than any of them
the lyre and the harp may be permitted in the town and the pan s pipe in the fields
thus we have made a purgation of music and will now make a purgation of metres
these should be like the harmonies simple and suitable to the occasion
there are four notes of the tetrachord and there are three ratios of metre 3 2 2 2 2 1 which have all their characteristics and the feet have different characteristics as well as the rhythms
but about this you and i must ask damon the great musician who speaks if i remember rightly of a martial measure as well as of dactylic trochaic and iambic rhythms which he arranges so as to equalize the syllables with one another assigning to each the proper quantity
we only venture to affirm the general principle that the style is to conform to the subject and the metre to the style and that the simplicity and harmony of the soul should be reflected in them all
this principle of simplicity has to be learnt by every one in the days of his youth and may be gathered anywhere from the creative and constructive arts as well as from the forms of plants and animals
other artists as well as poets should be warned against meanness or unseemliness
sculpture and painting equally with music must conform to the law of simplicity
he who violates it cannot be allowed to work in our city and to corrupt the taste of our citizens
for our guardians must grow up not amid images of deformity which will gradually poison and corrupt their souls but in a land of health and beauty where they will drink in from every object sweet and harmonious influences
and of all these influences the greatest is the education given by music which finds a way into the innermost soul and imparts to it the sense of beauty and of deformity
at first the effect is unconscious but when reason arrives then he who has been thus trained welcomes her as the friend whom he always knew
as in learning to read first we acquire the elements or letters separately and afterwards their combinations and cannot recognize reflections of them until we know the letters themselves in like manner we must first attain the elements or essential forms of the virtues and then trace their combinations in life and experience
there is a music of the soul which answers to the harmony of the world and the fairest object of a musical soul is the fair mind in the fair body
some defect in the latter may be excused but not in the former
true love is the daughter of temperance and temperance is utterly opposed to the madness of bodily pleasure
enough has been said of music which makes a fair ending with love
next we pass on to gymnastics about which i would remark that the soul is related to the body as a cause to an effect and therefore if we educate the mind we may leave the education of the body in her charge and need only give a general outline of the course to be pursued
in the first place the guardians must abstain from strong drink for they should be the last persons to lose their wits
whether the habits of the palaestra are suitable to them is more doubtful for the ordinary gymnastic is a sleepy sort of thing and if left off suddenly is apt to endanger health
but our warrior athletes must be wide awake dogs and must also be inured to all changes of food and climate
hence they will require a simpler kind of gymnastic akin to their simple music and for their diet a rule may be found in homer who feeds his heroes on roast meat only and gives them no fish although they are living at the sea side nor boiled meats which involve an apparatus of pots and pans and if i am not mistaken he nowhere mentions sweet sauces
sicilian cookery and attic confections and corinthian courtezans which are to gymnastic what lydian and ionian melodies are to music must be forbidden
where gluttony and intemperance prevail the town quickly fills with doctors and pleaders and law and medicine give themselves airs as soon as the freemen of a state take an interest in them
but what can show a more disgraceful state of education than to have to go abroad for justice because you have none of your own at home
and yet there is a worse stage of the same disease when men have learned to take a pleasure and pride in the twists and turns of the law not considering how much better it would be for them so to order their lives as to have no need of a nodding justice
and there is a like disgrace in employing a physician not for the cure of wounds or epidemic disorders but because a man has by laziness and luxury contracted diseases which were unknown in the days of asclepius
how simple is the homeric practice of medicine
eurypylus after he has been wounded drinks a posset of pramnian wine which is of a heating nature and yet the sons of asclepius blame neither the damsel who gives him the drink nor patroclus who is attending on him
the truth is that this modern system of nursing diseases was introduced by herodicus the trainer who being of a sickly constitution by a compound of training and medicine tortured first himself and then a good many other people and lived a great deal longer than he had any right
but asclepius would not practise this art because he knew that the citizens of a well ordered state have no leisure to be ill and therefore he adopted the kill or cure method which artisans and labourers employ
they must be at their business they say and have no time for coddling if they recover well if they don t there is an end of them
whereas the rich man is supposed to be a gentleman who can afford to be ill
do you know a maxim of phocylides that when a man begins to be rich he should practise virtue 
but how can excessive care of health be inconsistent with an ordinary occupation and yet consistent with that practice of virtue which phocylides inculcates
when a student imagines that philosophy gives him a headache he never does anything he is always unwell
this was the reason why asclepius and his sons practised no such art
they were acting in the interest of the public and did not wish to preserve useless lives or raise up a puny offspring to wretched sires
honest diseases they honestly cured and if a man was wounded they applied the proper remedies and then let him eat and drink what he liked
but they declined to treat intemperate and worthless subjects even though they might have made large fortunes out of them
as to the story of pindar that asclepius was slain by a thunderbolt for restoring a rich man to life that is a lie following our old rule we must say either that he did not take bribes or that he was not the son of a god
glaucon then asks socrates whether the best physicians and the best judges will not be those who have had severally the greatest experience of diseases and of crimes
socrates draws a distinction between the two professions
the physician should have had experience of disease in his own body for he cures with his mind and not with his body
but the judge controls mind by mind and therefore his mind should not be corrupted by crime
where then is he to gain experience
how is he to be wise and also innocent
when young a good man is apt to be deceived by evil doers because he has no pattern of evil in himself and therefore the judge should be of a certain age his youth should have been innocent and he should have acquired insight into evil not by the practice of it but by the observation of it in others
this is the ideal of a judge the criminal turned detective is wonderfully suspicious but when in company with good men who have experience he is at fault for he foolishly imagines that every one is as bad as himself
vice may be known of virtue but cannot know virtue
this is the sort of medicine and this the sort of law which will prevail in our state they will be healing arts to better natures but the evil body will be left to die by the one and the evil soul will be put to death by the other
and the need of either will be greatly diminished by good music which will give harmony to the soul and good gymnastic which will give health to the body
not that this division of music and gymnastic really corresponds to soul and body for they are both equally concerned with the soul which is tamed by the one and aroused and sustained by the other
the two together supply our guardians with their twofold nature
the passionate disposition when it has too much gymnastic is hardened and brutalized the gentle or philosophic temper which has too much music becomes enervated
while a man is allowing music to pour like water through the funnel of his ears the edge of his soul gradually wears away and the passionate or spirited element is melted out of him
too little spirit is easily exhausted too much quickly passes into nervous irritability
so again the athlete by feeding and training has his courage doubled but he soon grows stupid he is like a wild beast ready to do everything by blows and nothing by counsel or policy
there are two principles in man reason and passion and to these not to the soul and body the two arts of music and gymnastic correspond
he who mingles them in harmonious concord is the true musician he shall be the presiding genius of our state
the next question is who are to be our rulers
first the elder must rule the younger and the best of the elders will be the best guardians
now they will be the best who love their subjects most and think that they have a common interest with them in the welfare of the state
these we must select but they must be watched at every epoch of life to see whether they have retained the same opinions and held out against force and enchantment
for time and persuasion and the love of pleasure may enchant a man into a change of purpose and the force of grief and pain may compel him
and therefore our guardians must be men who have been tried by many tests like gold in the refiner s fire and have been passed first through danger then through pleasure and at every age have come out of such trials victorious and without stain in full command of themselves and their principles having all their faculties in harmonious exercise for their country s good
these shall receive the highest honours both in life and death
and now for one magnificent lie in the belief of which oh that we could train our rulers
at any rate let us make the attempt with the rest of the world
what i am going to tell is only another version of the legend of cadmus but our unbelieving generation will be slow to accept such a story
the tale must be imparted first to the rulers then to the soldiers lastly to the people
we will inform them that their youth was a dream and that during the time when they seemed to be undergoing their education they were really being fashioned in the earth who sent them up when they were ready and that they must protect and cherish her whose children they are and regard each other as brothers and sisters
i do not wonder at your being ashamed to propound such a fiction
there is more behind
these brothers and sisters have different natures and some of them god framed to rule whom he fashioned of gold others he made of silver to be auxiliaries others again to be husbandmen and craftsmen and these were formed by him of brass and iron
but as they are all sprung from a common stock a golden parent may have a silver son or a silver parent a golden son and then there must be a change of rank the son of the rich must descend and the child of the artisan rise in the social scale for an oracle says that the state will come to an end if governed by a man of brass or iron
will our citizens ever believe all this
not in the present generation but in the next perhaps yes
now let the earthborn men go forth under the command of their rulers and look about and pitch their camp in a high place which will be safe against enemies from without and likewise against insurrections from within
there let them sacrifice and set up their tents for soldiers they are to be and not shopkeepers the watchdogs and guardians of the sheep and luxury and avarice will turn them into wolves and tyrants
their habits and their dwellings should correspond to their education
they should have no property their pay should only meet their expenses and they should have common meals
gold and silver we will tell them that they have from god and this divine gift in their souls they must not alloy with that earthly dross which passes under the name of gold
they only of the citizens may not touch it or be under the same roof with it or drink from it it is the accursed thing
should they ever acquire houses or lands or money of their own they will become householders and tradesmen instead of guardians enemies and tyrants instead of helpers and the hour of ruin both to themselves and the rest of the state will be at hand
the religious and ethical aspect of plato s education will hereafter be considered under a separate head
some lesser points may be more conveniently noticed in this place
1
the constant appeal to the authority of homer whom with grave irony plato after the manner of his age summons as a witness about ethics and psychology as well as about diet and medicine attempting to distinguish the better lesson from the worse sometimes altering the text from design more than once quoting or alluding to homer inaccurately after the manner of the early logographers turning the iliad into prose and delighting to draw far fetched inferences from his words or to make ludicrous applications of them
he does not like heracleitus get into a rage with homer and archilochus but uses their words and expressions as vehicles of a higher truth not on a system like theagenes of rhegium or metrodorus or in later times the stoics but as fancy may dictate
and the conclusions drawn from them are sound although the premises are fictitious
these fanciful appeals to homer add a charm to plato s style and at the same time they have the effect of a satire on the follies of homeric interpretation
to us although they take the form of arguments they are really figures of speech
they may be compared with modern citations from scripture which have often a great rhetorical power even when the original meaning of the words is entirely lost sight of
the real like the platonic socrates as we gather from the memorabilia of xenophon was fond of making similar adaptations
great in all ages and countries in religion as well as in law and literature has been the art of interpretation
2
the style is to conform to the subject and the metre to the style
notwithstanding the fascination which the word classical exercises over us we can hardly maintain that this rule is observed in all the greek poetry which has come down to us
we cannot deny that the thought often exceeds the power of lucid expression in aeschylus and pindar or that rhetoric gets the better of the thought in the sophist poet euripides
only perhaps in sophocles is there a perfect harmony of the two in him alone do we find a grace of language like the beauty of a greek statue in which there is nothing to add or to take away at least this is true of single plays or of large portions of them
the connection in the tragic choruses and in the greek lyric poets is not unfrequently a tangled thread which in an age before logic the poet was unable to draw out
many thoughts and feelings mingled in his mind and he had no power of disengaging or arranging them
for there is a subtle influence of logic which requires to be transferred from prose to poetry just as the music and perfection of language are infused by poetry into prose
in all ages the poet has been a bad judge of his own meaning for he does not see that the word which is full of associations to his own mind is difficult and unmeaning to that of another or that the sequence which is clear to himself is puzzling to others
there are many passages in some of our greatest modern poets which are far too obscure in which there is no proportion between style and subject in which any half expressed figure any harsh construction any distorted collocation of words any remote sequence of ideas is admitted and there is no voice coming sweetly from nature or music adding the expression of feeling to thought
as if there could be poetry without beauty or beauty without ease and clearness
the obscurities of early greek poets arose necessarily out of the state of language and logic which existed in their age
they are not examples to be followed by us for the use of language ought in every generation to become clearer and clearer
like shakespere they were great in spite not in consequence of their imperfections of expression
but there is no reason for returning to the necessary obscurity which prevailed in the infancy of literature
the english poets of the last century were certainly not obscure and we have no excuse for losing what they had gained or for going back to the earlier or transitional age which preceded them
the thought of our own times has not out stripped language a want of plato s art of measuring is the rule cause of the disproportion between them
3
in the third book of the republic a nearer approach is made to a theory of art than anywhere else in plato
his views may be summed up as follows true art is not fanciful and imitative but simple and ideal the expression of the highest moral energy whether in action or repose
to live among works of plastic art which are of this noble and simple character or to listen to such strains is the best of influences the true greek atmosphere in which youth should be brought up
that is the way to create in them a natural good taste which will have a feeling of truth and beauty in all things
for though the poets are to be expelled still art is recognized as another aspect of reason like love in the symposium extending over the same sphere but confined to the preliminary education and acting through the power of habit and this conception of art is not limited to strains of music or the forms of plastic art but pervades all nature and has a wide kindred in the world
the republic of plato like the athens of pericles has an artistic as well as a political side
there is hardly any mention in plato of the creative arts only in two or three passages does he even allude to them 
he is not lost in rapture at the great works of phidias the parthenon the propylea the statues of zeus or athene
he would probably have regarded any abstract truth of number or figure as higher than the greatest of them
yet it is hard to suppose that some influence such as he hopes to inspire in youth did not pass into his own mind from the works of art which he saw around him
we are living upon the fragments of them and find in a few broken stones the standard of truth and beauty
but in plato this feeling has no expression he nowhere says that beauty is the object of art he seems to deny that wisdom can take an external form he does not distinguish the fine from the mechanical arts
whether or no like some writers he felt more than he expressed it is at any rate remarkable that the greatest perfection of the fine arts should coincide with an almost entire silence about them
in one very striking passage he tells us that a work of art like the state is a whole and this conception of a whole and the love of the newly born mathematical sciences may be regarded if not as the inspiring at any rate as the regulating principles of greek art 
4
plato makes the true and subtle remark that the physician had better not be in robust health and should have known what illness is in his own person
but the judge ought to have had no similar experience of evil he is to be a good man who having passed his youth in innocence became acquainted late in life with the vices of others
and therefore according to plato a judge should not be young just as a young man according to aristotle is not fit to be a hearer of moral philosophy
the bad on the other hand have a knowledge of vice but no knowledge of virtue
it may be doubted however whether this train of reflection is well founded
in a remarkable passage of the laws it is acknowledged that the evil may form a correct estimate of the good
the union of gentleness and courage in book ii
at first seemed to be a paradox yet was afterwards ascertained to be a truth
and plato might also have found that the intuition of evil may be consistent with the abhorrence of it
there is a directness of aim in virtue which gives an insight into vice
and the knowledge of character is in some degree a natural sense independent of any special experience of good or evil
5
one of the most remarkable conceptions of plato because un greek and also very different from anything which existed at all in his age of the world is the transposition of ranks
in the spartan state there had been enfranchisement of helots and degradation of citizens under special circumstances
and in the ancient greek aristocracies merit was certainly recognized as one of the elements on which government was based
the founders of states were supposed to be their benefactors who were raised by their great actions above the ordinary level of humanity at a later period the services of warriors and legislators were held to entitle them and their descendants to the privileges of citizenship and to the first rank in the state
and although the existence of an ideal aristocracy is slenderly proven from the remains of early greek history and we have a difficulty in ascribing such a character however the idea may be defined to any actual hellenic state or indeed to any state which has ever existed in the world still the rule of the best was certainly the aspiration of philosophers who probably accommodated a good deal their views of primitive history to their own notions of good government
plato further insists on applying to the guardians of his state a series of tests by which all those who fell short of a fixed standard were either removed from the governing body or not admitted to it and this academic discipline did to a certain extent prevail in greek states especially in sparta
he also indicates that the system of caste which existed in a great part of the ancient and is by no means extinct in the modern european world should be set aside from time to time in favour of merit
he is aware how deeply the greater part of mankind resent any interference with the order of society and therefore he proposes his novel idea in the form of what he himself calls a monstrous fiction
two principles are indicated by him first that there is a distinction of ranks dependent on circumstances prior to the individual second that this distinction is and ought to be broken through by personal qualities
he adapts mythology like the homeric poems to the wants of the state making the phoenician tale the vehicle of his ideas
every greek state had a myth respecting its own origin the platonic republic may also have a tale of earthborn men
the gravity and verisimilitude with which the tale is told and the analogy of greek tradition are a sufficient verification of the monstrous falsehood
ancient poetry had spoken of a gold and silver and brass and iron age succeeding one another but plato supposes these differences in the natures of men to exist together in a single state
mythology supplies a figure under which the lesson may be taught and also enables plato to touch lightly on new principles without going into details
in this passage he shadows forth a general truth but he does not tell us by what steps the transposition of ranks is to be effected
indeed throughout the republic he allows the lower ranks to fade into the distance
we do not know whether they are to carry arms and whether in the fifth book they are or are not included in the communistic regulations respecting property and marriage
nor is there any use in arguing strictly either from a few chance words or from the silence of plato or in drawing inferences which were beyond his vision
aristotle in his criticism on the position of the lower classes does not perceive that the poetical creation is like the air invulnerable and cannot be penetrated by the shafts of his logic 
6
two paradoxes which strike the modern reader as in the highest degree fanciful and ideal and which suggest to him many reflections are to be found in the third book of the republic first the great power of music so much beyond any influence which is experienced by us in modern times when the art or science has been far more developed and has found the secret of harmony as well as of melody secondly the indefinite and almost absolute control which the soul is supposed to exercise over the body
in the first we suspect some degree of exaggeration such as we may also observe among certain masters of the art not unknown to us at the present day
with this natural enthusiasm which is felt by a few only there seems to mingle in plato a sort of pythagorean reverence for numbers and numerical proportion to which aristotle is a stranger
intervals of sound and number are to him sacred things which have a law of their own not dependent on the variations of sense
they rise above sense and become a connecting link with the world of ideas
but it is evident that plato is describing what to him appears to be also a fact
the power of a simple and characteristic melody on the impressible mind of the greek is more than we can easily appreciate
the effect of national airs may bear some comparison with it
and besides all this there is a confusion between the harmony of musical notes and the harmony of soul and body which is so potently inspired by them
the second paradox leads up to some curious and interesting questions how far can the mind control the body
is the relation between them one of mutual antagonism or of mutual harmony
are they two or one and is either of them the cause of the other
may we not at times drop the opposition between them and the mode of describing them which is so familiar to us and yet hardly conveys any precise meaning and try to view this composite creature man in a more simple manner
must we not at any rate admit that there is in human nature a higher and a lower principle divided by no distinct line which at times break asunder and take up arms against one another
or again they are reconciled and move together either unconsciously in the ordinary work of life or consciously in the pursuit of some noble aim to be attained not without an effort and for which every thought and nerve are strained
and then the body becomes the good friend or ally or servant or instrument of the mind
and the mind has often a wonderful and almost superhuman power of banishing disease and weakness and calling out a hidden strength
reason and the desires the intellect and the senses are brought into harmony and obedience so as to form a single human being
they are ever parting ever meeting and the identity or diversity of their tendencies or operations is for the most part unnoticed by us
when the mind touches the body through the appetites we acknowledge the responsibility of the one to the other
there is a tendency in us which says drink
there is another which says do not drink it is not good for you
and we all of us know which is the rightful superior
we are also responsible for our health although into this sphere there enter some elements of necessity which may be beyond our control
still even in the management of health care and thought continued over many years may make us almost free agents if we do not exact too much of ourselves and if we acknowledge that all human freedom is limited by the laws of nature and of mind
we are disappointed to find that plato in the general condemnation which he passes on the practice of medicine prevailing in his own day depreciates the effects of diet
he would like to have diseases of a definite character and capable of receiving a definite treatment
he is afraid of invalidism interfering with the business of life
he does not recognize that time is the great healer both of mental and bodily disorders and that remedies which are gradual and proceed little by little are safer than those which produce a sudden catastrophe
neither does he see that there is no way in which the mind can more surely influence the body than by the control of eating and drinking or any other action or occasion of human life on which the higher freedom of the will can be more simple or truly asserted

lesser matters of style may be remarked
the affected ignorance of music which is plato s way of expressing that he is passing lightly over the subject
the tentative manner in which here as in the second book he proceeds with the construction of the state
the description of the state sometimes as a reality and then again as a work of imagination only these are the arts by which he sustains the reader s interest
connecting links or the preparation for the entire expulsion of the poets in book x
the companion pictures of the lover of litigation and the valetudinarian the satirical jest about the maxim of phocylides the manner in which the image of the gold and silver citizens is taken up into the subject and the argument from the practice of asclepius should not escape notice
book iv
adeimantus said suppose a person to argue socrates that you make your citizens miserable and this by their own free will they are the lords of the city and yet instead of having like other men lands and houses and money of their own they live as mercenaries and are always mounting guard
you may add i replied that they receive no pay but only their food and have no money to spend on a journey or a mistress
well and what answer do you give
my answer is that our guardians may or may not be the happiest of men i should not be surprised to find in the long run that they were but this is not the aim of our constitution which was designed for the good of the whole and not of any one part
if i went to a sculptor and blamed him for having painted the eye which is the noblest feature of the face not purple but black he would reply the eye must be an eye and you should look at the statue as a whole
now i can well imagine a fool s paradise in which everybody is eating and drinking clothed in purple and fine linen and potters lie on sofas and have their wheel at hand that they may work a little when they please and cobblers and all the other classes of a state lose their distinctive character
and a state may get on without cobblers but when the guardians degenerate into boon companions then the ruin is complete
remember that we are not talking of peasants keeping holiday but of a state in which every man is expected to do his own work
the happiness resides not in this or that class but in the state as a whole
i have another remark to make a middle condition is best for artisans they should have money enough to buy tools and not enough to be independent of business
and will not the same condition be best for our citizens
if they are poor they will be mean if rich luxurious and lazy and in neither case contented
but then how will our poor city be able to go to war against an enemy who has money
there may be a difficulty in fighting against one enemy against two there will be none
in the first place the contest will be carried on by trained warriors against well to do citizens and is not a regular athlete an easy match for two stout opponents at least
suppose also that before engaging we send ambassadors to one of the two cities saying silver and gold we have not do you help us and take our share of the spoil who would fight against the lean wiry dogs when they might join with them in preying upon the fatted sheep
but if many states join their resources shall we not be in danger
i am amused to hear you use the word state of any but our own state
they are states but not a state many in one
for in every state there are two hostile nations rich and poor which you may set one against the other
but our state while she remains true to her principles will be in very deed the mightiest of hellenic states
to the size of the state there is no limit but the necessity of unity it must be neither too large nor too small to be one
this is a matter of secondary importance like the principle of transposition which was intimated in the parable of the earthborn men
the meaning there implied was that every man should do that for which he was fitted and be at one with himself and then the whole city would be united
but all these things are secondary if education which is the great matter be duly regarded
when the wheel has once been set in motion the speed is always increasing and each generation improves upon the preceding both in physical and moral qualities
the care of the governors should be directed to preserve music and gymnastic from innovation alter the songs of a country damon says and you will soon end by altering its laws
the change appears innocent at first and begins in play but the evil soon becomes serious working secretly upon the characters of individuals then upon social and commercial relations and lastly upon the institutions of a state and there is ruin and confusion everywhere
but if education remains in the established form there will be no danger
a restorative process will be always going on the spirit of law and order will raise up what has fallen down
nor will any regulations be needed for the lesser matters of life rules of deportment or fashions of dress
like invites like for good or for evil
education will correct deficiencies and supply the power of self government
far be it from us to enter into the particulars of legislation let the guardians take care of education and education will take care of all other things
but without education they may patch and mend as they please they will make no progress any more than a patient who thinks to cure himself by some favourite remedy and will not give up his luxurious mode of living
if you tell such persons that they must first alter their habits then they grow angry they are charming people
charming nay the very reverse
evidently these gentlemen are not in your good graces nor the state which is like them
and such states there are which first ordain under penalty of death that no one shall alter the constitution and then suffer themselves to be flattered into and out of anything and he who indulges them and fawns upon them is their leader and saviour
yes the men are as bad as the states
but do you not admire their cleverness
nay some of them are stupid enough to believe what the people tell them
and when all the world is telling a man that he is six feet high and he has no measure how can he believe anything else
but don t get into a passion to see our statesmen trying their nostrums and fancying that they can cut off at a blow the hydra like rogueries of mankind is as good as a play
minute enactments are superfluous in good states and are useless in bad ones
and now what remains of the work of legislation
nothing for us but to apollo the god of delphi we leave the ordering of the greatest of all things that is to say religion
only our ancestral deity sitting upon the centre and navel of the earth will be trusted by us if we have any sense in an affair of such magnitude
no foreign god shall be supreme in our realms
here as socrates would say let us reflect on what has preceded thus far we have spoken not of the happiness of the citizens but only of the well being of the state
they may be the happiest of men but our principal aim in founding the state was not to make them happy
they were to be guardians not holiday makers
in this pleasant manner is presented to us the famous question both of ancient and modern philosophy touching the relation of duty to happiness of right to utility
first duty then happiness is the natural order of our moral ideas
the utilitarian principle is valuable as a corrective of error and shows to us a side of ethics which is apt to be neglected
it may be admitted further that right and utility are co extensive and that he who makes the happiness of mankind his object has one of the highest and noblest motives of human action
but utility is not the historical basis of morality nor the aspect in which moral and religious ideas commonly occur to the mind
the greatest happiness of all is as we believe the far off result of the divine government of the universe
the greatest happiness of the individual is certainly to be found in a life of virtue and goodness
but we seem to be more assured of a law of right than we can be of a divine purpose that all mankind should be saved and we infer the one from the other
and the greatest happiness of the individual may be the reverse of the greatest happiness in the ordinary sense of the term and may be realised in a life of pain or in a voluntary death
further the word happiness has several ambiguities it may mean either pleasure or an ideal life happiness subjective or objective in this world or in another of ourselves only or of our neighbours and of all men everywhere
by the modern founder of utilitarianism the self regarding and disinterested motives of action are included under the same term although they are commonly opposed by us as benevolence and self love
the word happiness has not the definiteness or the sacredness of truth and right it does not equally appeal to our higher nature and has not sunk into the conscience of mankind
it is associated too much with the comforts and conveniences of life too little with the goods of the soul which we desire for their own sake
in a great trial or danger or temptation or in any great and heroic action it is scarcely thought of
for these reasons the greatest happiness principle is not the true foundation of ethics
but though not the first principle it is the second which is like unto it and is often of easier application
for the larger part of human actions are neither right nor wrong except in so far as they tend to the happiness of mankind 
the same question reappears in politics where the useful or expedient seems to claim a larger sphere and to have a greater authority
for concerning political measures we chiefly ask how will they affect the happiness of mankind
yet here too we may observe that what we term expediency is merely the law of right limited by the conditions of human society
right and truth are the highest aims of government as well as of individuals and we ought not to lose sight of them because we cannot directly enforce them
they appeal to the better mind of nations and sometimes they are too much for merely temporal interests to resist
they are the watchwords which all men use in matters of public policy as well as in their private dealings the peace of europe may be said to depend upon them
in the most commercial and utilitarian states of society the power of ideas remains
and all the higher class of statesmen have in them something of that idealism which pericles is said to have gathered from the teaching of anaxagoras
they recognise that the true leader of men must be above the motives of ambition and that national character is of greater value than material comfort and prosperity
and this is the order of thought in plato first he expects his citizens to do their duty and then under favourable circumstances that is to say in a well ordered state their happiness is assured
that he was far from excluding the modern principle of utility in politics is sufficiently evident from other passages in which the most beneficial is affirmed to be the most honourable and also the most sacred 
we may note the manner in which the objection of adeimantus here is designed to draw out and deepen the argument of socrates
the conception of a whole as lying at the foundation both of politics and of art in the latter supplying the only principle of criticism which under the various names of harmony symmetry measure proportion unity the greek seems to have applied to works of art
the requirement that the state should be limited in size after the traditional model of a greek state as in the politics of aristotle the fact that the cities of hellas were small is converted into a principle
the humorous pictures of the lean dogs and the fatted sheep of the light active boxer upsetting two stout gentlemen at least of the charming patients who are always making themselves worse or again the playful assumption that there is no state but our own or the grave irony with which the statesman is excused who believes that he is six feet high because he is told so and having nothing to measure with is to be pardoned for his ignorance he is too amusing for us to be seriously angry with him
the light and superficial manner in which religion is passed over when provision has been made for two great principles first that religion shall be based on the highest conception of the gods secondly that the true national or hellenic type shall be maintained
socrates proceeds but where amid all this is justice
son of ariston tell me where
light a candle and search the city and get your brother and the rest of our friends to help in seeking for her
that won t do replied glaucon you yourself promised to make the search and talked about the impiety of deserting justice
well i said i will lead the way but do you follow
my notion is that our state being perfect will contain all the four virtues wisdom courage temperance justice
if we eliminate the three first the unknown remainder will be justice
first then of wisdom the state which we have called into being will be wise because politic
and policy is one among many kinds of skill not the skill of the carpenter or of the worker in metal or of the husbandman but the skill of him who advises about the interests of the whole state
of such a kind is the skill of the guardians who are a small class in number far smaller than the blacksmiths but in them is concentrated the wisdom of the state
and if this small ruling class have wisdom then the whole state will be wise
our second virtue is courage which we have no difficulty in finding in another class that of soldiers
courage may be defined as a sort of salvation the never failing salvation of the opinions which law and education have prescribed concerning dangers
you know the way in which dyers first prepare the white ground and then lay on the dye of purple or of any other colour
colours dyed in this way become fixed and no soap or lye will ever wash them out
now the ground is education and the laws are the colours and if the ground is properly laid neither the soap of pleasure nor the lye of pain or fear will ever wash them out
this power which preserves right opinion about danger i would ask you to call courage adding the epithet political or civilized in order to distinguish it from mere animal courage and from a higher courage which may hereafter be discussed
two virtues remain temperance and justice
more than the preceding virtues temperance suggests the idea of harmony
some light is thrown upon the nature of this virtue by the popular description of a man as master of himself which has an absurd sound because the master is also the servant
the expression really means that the better principle in a man masters the worse
there are in cities whole classes women slaves and the like who correspond to the worse and a few only to the better and in our state the former class are held under control by the latter
now to which of these classes does temperance belong
to both of them
and our state if any will be the abode of temperance and we were right in describing this virtue as a harmony which is diffused through the whole making the dwellers in the city to be of one mind and attuning the upper and middle and lower classes like the strings of an instrument whether you suppose them to differ in wisdom strength or wealth
and now we are near the spot let us draw in and surround the cover and watch with all our eyes lest justice should slip away and escape
tell me if you see the thicket move first
nay i would have you lead
well then offer up a prayer and follow
the way is dark and difficult but we must push on
i begin to see a track
good news
why glaucon our dulness of scent is quite ludicrous
while we are straining our eyes into the distance justice is tumbling out at our feet
we are as bad as people looking for a thing which they have in their hands
have you forgotten our old principle of the division of labour or of every man doing his own business concerning which we spoke at the foundation of the state what but this was justice
is there any other virtue remaining which can compete with wisdom and temperance and courage in the scale of political virtue
for every one having his own is the great object of government and the great object of trade is that every man should do his own business
not that there is much harm in a carpenter trying to be a cobbler or a cobbler transforming himself into a carpenter but great evil may arise from the cobbler leaving his last and turning into a guardian or legislator or when a single individual is trainer warrior legislator all in one
and this evil is injustice or every man doing another s business
i do not say that as yet we are in a condition to arrive at a final conclusion
for the definition which we believe to hold good in states has still to be tested by the individual
having read the large letters we will now come back to the small
from the two together a brilliant light may be struck out
socrates proceeds to discover the nature of justice by a method of residues
each of the first three virtues corresponds to one of the three parts of the soul and one of the three classes in the state although the third temperance has more of the nature of a harmony than the first two
if there be a fourth virtue that can only be sought for in the relation of the three parts in the soul or classes in the state to one another
it is obvious and simple and for that very reason has not been found out
the modern logician will be inclined to object that ideas cannot be separated like chemical substances but that they run into one another and may be only different aspects or names of the same thing and such in this instance appears to be the case
for the definition here given of justice is verbally the same as one of the definitions of temperance given by socrates in the charmides which however is only provisional and is afterwards rejected
and so far from justice remaining over when the other virtues are eliminated the justice and temperance of the republic can with difficulty be distinguished
temperance appears to be the virtue of a part only and one of three whereas justice is a universal virtue of the whole soul
yet on the other hand temperance is also described as a sort of harmony and in this respect is akin to justice
justice seems to differ from temperance in degree rather than in kind whereas temperance is the harmony of discordant elements justice is the perfect order by which all natures and classes do their own business the right man in the right place the division and co operation of all the citizens
justice again is a more abstract notion than the other virtues and therefore from plato s point of view the foundation of them to which they are referred and which in idea precedes them
the proposal to omit temperance is a mere trick of style intended to avoid monotony
there is a famous question discussed in one of the earlier dialogues of plato whether the virtues are one or many
this receives an answer which is to the effect that there are four cardinal virtues and one supreme over the rest which is not like aristotle s conception of universal justice virtue relative to others but the whole of virtue relative to the parts
to this universal conception of justice or order in the first education and in the moral nature of man the still more universal conception of the good in the second education and in the sphere of speculative knowledge seems to succeed
both might be equally described by the terms law order harmony but while the idea of good embraces all time and all existence the conception of justice is not extended beyond man
.socrates is now going to identify the individual and the state
but first he must prove that there are three parts of the individual soul
his argument is as follows quantity makes no difference in quality
the word just whether applied to the individual or to the state has the same meaning
and the term justice implied that the same three principles in the state and in the individual were doing their own business
but are they really three or one
the question is difficult and one which can hardly be solved by the methods which we are now using but the truer and longer way would take up too much of our time
the shorter will satisfy me
well then you would admit that the qualities of states mean the qualities of the individuals who compose them
the scythians and thracians are passionate our own race intellectual and the egyptians and phoenicians covetous because the individual members of each have such and such a character the difficulty is to determine whether the several principles are one or three whether that is to say we reason with one part of our nature desire with another are angry with another or whether the whole soul comes into play in each sort of action
this enquiry however requires a very exact definition of terms
the same thing in the same relation cannot be affected in two opposite ways
but there is no impossibility in a man standing still yet moving his arms or in a top which is fixed on one spot going round upon its axis
there is no necessity to mention all the possible exceptions let us provisionally assume that opposites cannot do or be or suffer opposites in the same relation
and to the class of opposites belong assent and dissent desire and avoidance
and one form of desire is thirst and hunger and here arises a new point thirst is thirst of drink hunger is hunger of food not of warm drink or of a particular kind of food with the single exception of course that the very fact of our desiring anything implies that it is good
when relative terms have no attributes their correlatives have no attributes when they have attributes their correlatives also have them
for example the term greater is simply relative to less and knowledge refers to a subject of knowledge
but on the other hand a particular knowledge is of a particular subject
again every science has a distinct character which is defined by an object medicine for example is the science of health although not to be confounded with health
having cleared our ideas thus far let us return to the original instance of thirst which has a definite object drink
now the thirsty soul may feel two distinct impulses the animal one saying drink the rational one which says do not drink
the two impulses are contradictory and therefore we may assume that they spring from distinct principles in the soul
but is passion a third principle or akin to desire
there is a story of a certain leontius which throws some light on this question
he was coming up from the piraeus outside the north wall and he passed a spot where there were dead bodies lying by the executioner
he felt a longing desire to see them and also an abhorrence of them at first he turned away and shut his eyes then suddenly tearing them open he said take your fill ye wretches of the fair sight
now is there not here a third principle which is often found to come to the assistance of reason against desire but never of desire against reason
this is passion or spirit of the separate existence of which we may further convince ourselves by putting the following case when a man suffers justly if he be of a generous nature he is not indignant at the hardships which he undergoes but when he suffers unjustly his indignation is his great support hunger and thirst cannot tame him the spirit within him must do or die until the voice of the shepherd that is of reason bidding his dog bark no more is heard within
this shows that passion is the ally of reason
is passion then the same with reason
no for the former exists in children and brutes and homer affords a proof of the distinction between them when he says he smote his breast and thus rebuked his soul
and now at last we have reached firm ground and are able to infer that the virtues of the state and of the individual are the same
for wisdom and courage and justice in the state are severally the wisdom and courage and justice in the individuals who form the state
each of the three classes will do the work of its own class in the state and each part in the individual soul reason the superior and passion the inferior will be harmonized by the influence of music and gymnastic
the counsellor and the warrior the head and the arm will act together in the town of mansoul and keep the desires in proper subjection
the courage of the warrior is that quality which preserves a right opinion about dangers in spite of pleasures and pains
the wisdom of the counsellor is that small part of the soul which has authority and reason
the virtue of temperance is the friendship of the ruling and the subject principles both in the state and in the individual
of justice we have already spoken and the notion already given of it may be confirmed by common instances
will the just state or the just individual steal lie commit adultery or be guilty of impiety to gods and men
no
and is not the reason of this that the several principles whether in the state or in the individual do their own business
and justice is the quality which makes just men and just states
moreover our old division of labour which required that there should be one man for one use was a dream or anticipation of what was to follow and that dream has now been realized in justice which begins by binding together the three chords of the soul and then acts harmoniously in every relation of life
and injustice which is the insubordination and disobedience of the inferior elements in the soul is the opposite of justice and is inharmonious and unnatural being to the soul what disease is to the body for in the soul as well as in the body good or bad actions produce good or bad habits
and virtue is the health and beauty and well being of the soul and vice is the disease and weakness and deformity of the soul
again the old question returns upon us is justice or injustice the more profitable
the question has become ridiculous
for injustice like mortal disease makes life not worth having
come up with me to the hill which overhangs the city and look down upon the single form of virtue and the infinite forms of vice among which are four special ones characteristic both of states and of individuals
and the state which corresponds to the single form of virtue is that which we have been describing wherein reason rules under one of two names monarchy and aristocracy
thus there are five forms in all both of states and of souls
in attempting to prove that the soul has three separate faculties plato takes occasion to discuss what makes difference of faculties
and the criterion which he proposes is difference in the working of the faculties
the same faculty cannot produce contradictory effects
but the path of early reasoners is beset by thorny entanglements and he will not proceed a step without first clearing the ground
this leads him into a tiresome digression which is intended to explain the nature of contradiction
first the contradiction must be at the same time and in the same relation
secondly no extraneous word must be introduced into either of the terms in which the contradictory proposition is expressed for example thirst is of drink not of warm drink
he implies what he does not say that if by the advice of reason or by the impulse of anger a man is restrained from drinking this proves that thirst or desire under which thirst is included is distinct from anger and reason
but suppose that we allow the term thirst or desire to be modified and say an angry thirst or a revengeful desire then the two spheres of desire and anger overlap and become confused
this case therefore has to be excluded
and still there remains an exception to the rule in the use of the term good which is always implied in the object of desire
these are the discussions of an age before logic and any one who is wearied by them should remember that they are necessary to the clearing up of ideas in the first development of the human faculties
the psychology of plato extends no further than the division of the soul into the rational irascible and concupiscent elements which as far as we know was first made by him and has been retained by aristotle and succeeding ethical writers
the chief difficulty in this early analysis of the mind is to define exactly the place of the irascible faculty which may be variously described under the terms righteous indignation spirit passion
it is the foundation of courage which includes in plato moral courage the courage of enduring pain and of surmounting intellectual difficulties as well as of meeting dangers in war
though irrational it inclines to side with the rational it cannot be aroused by punishment when justly inflicted it sometimes takes the form of an enthusiasm which sustains a man in the performance of great actions
it is the lion heart with which the reason makes a treaty
on the other hand it is negative rather than positive it is indignant at wrong or falsehood but does not like love in the symposium and phaedrus aspire to the vision of truth or good
it is the peremptory military spirit which prevails in the government of honour
it differs from anger this latter term having no accessory notion of righteous indignation
although aristotle has retained the word yet we may observe that passion has with him lost its affinity to the rational and has become indistinguishable from anger 
and to this vernacular use plato himself in the laws seems to revert though not always
by modern philosophy too as well as in our ordinary conversation the words anger or passion are employed almost exclusively in a bad sense there is no connotation of a just or reasonable cause by which they are aroused
the feeling of righteous indignation is too partial and accidental to admit of our regarding it as a separate virtue or habit
we are tempted also to doubt whether plato is right in supposing that an offender however justly condemned could be expected to acknowledge the justice of his sentence this is the spirit of a philosopher or martyr rather than of a criminal
we may observe how nearly plato approaches aristotle s famous thesis that good actions produce good habits
the words as healthy practices produce health so do just practices produce justice have a sound very like the nicomachean ethics
but we note also that an incidental remark in plato has become a far reaching principle in aristotle and an inseparable part of a great ethical system
there is a difficulty in understanding what plato meant by the longer way he seems to intimate some metaphysic of the future which will not be satisfied with arguing from the principle of contradiction
in the sixth and seventh books he has given us a sketch of such a metaphysic but when glaucon asks for the final revelation of the idea of good he is put off with the declaration that he has not yet studied the preliminary sciences
how he would have filled up the sketch or argued about such questions from a higher point of view we can only conjecture
perhaps he hoped to find some a priori method of developing the parts out of the whole or he might have asked which of the ideas contains the other ideas and possibly have stumbled on the hegelian identity of the ego and the universal
or he may have imagined that ideas might be constructed in some manner analogous to the construction of figures and numbers in the mathematical sciences
the most certain and necessary truth was to plato the universal and to this he was always seeking to refer all knowledge or opinion just as in modern times we seek to rest them on the opposite pole of induction and experience
the aspirations of metaphysicians have always tended to pass beyond the limits of human thought and language they seem to have reached a height at which they are moving about in worlds unrealized and their conceptions although profoundly affecting their own minds become invisible or unintelligible to others
we are not therefore surprized to find that plato himself has nowhere clearly explained his doctrine of ideas or that his school in a later generation like his contemporaries glaucon and adeimantus were unable to follow him in this region of speculation
in the sophist where he is refuting the scepticism which maintained either that there was no such thing as predication or that all might be predicated of all he arrives at the conclusion that some ideas combine with some but not all with all
but he makes only one or two steps forward on this path he nowhere attains to any connected system of ideas or even to a knowledge of the most elementary relations of the sciences to one another
book v
i was going to enumerate the four forms of vice or decline in states when polemarchus he was sitting a little farther from me than adeimantus taking him by the coat and leaning towards him said something in an undertone of which i only caught the words shall we let him off
certainly not said adeimantus raising his voice
whom i said are you not going to let off
you he said
why
because we think that you are not dealing fairly with us in omitting women and children of whom you have slily disposed under the general formula that friends have all things in common
and was i not right
yes he replied but there are many sorts of communism or community and we want to know which of them is right
the company as you have just heard are resolved to have a further explanation
thrasymachus said do you think that we have come hither to dig for gold or to hear you discourse
yes i said but the discourse should be of a reasonable length
glaucon added yes socrates and there is reason in spending the whole of life in such discussions but pray without more ado tell us how this community is to be carried out and how the interval between birth and education is to be filled up
well i said the subject has several difficulties what is possible
is the first question
what is desirable
is the second
fear not he replied for you are speaking among friends
that i replied is a sorry consolation i shall destroy my friends as well as myself
not that i mind a little innocent laughter but he who kills the truth is a murderer
then said glaucon laughing in case you should murder us we will acquit you beforehand and you shall be held free from the guilt of deceiving us
socrates proceeds the guardians of our state are to be watch dogs as we have already said
now dogs are not divided into hes and shes we do not take the masculine gender out to hunt and leave the females at home to look after their puppies
they have the same employments the only difference between them is that the one sex is stronger and the other weaker
but if women are to have the same employments as men they must have the same education they must be taught music and gymnastics and the art of war
i know that a great joke will be made of their riding on horseback and carrying weapons the sight of the naked old wrinkled women showing their agility in the palaestra will certainly not be a vision of beauty and may be expected to become a famous jest
but we must not mind the wits there was a time when they might have laughed at our present gymnastics
all is habit people have at last found out that the exposure is better than the concealment of the person and now they laugh no more
evil only should be the subject of ridicule
the first question is whether women are able either wholly or partially to share in the employments of men
and here we may be charged with inconsistency in making the proposal at all
for we started originally with the division of labour and the diversity of employments was based on the difference of natures
but is there no difference between men and women
nay are they not wholly different
there was the difficulty glaucon which made me unwilling to speak of family relations
however when a man is out of his depth whether in a pool or in an ocean he can only swim for his life and we must try to find a way of escape if we can
the argument is that different natures have different uses and the natures of men and women are said to differ
but this is only a verbal opposition
we do not consider that the difference may be purely nominal and accidental for example a bald man and a hairy man are opposed in a single point of view but you cannot infer that because a bald man is a cobbler a hairy man ought not to be a cobbler
now why is such an inference erroneous
simply because the opposition between them is partial only like the difference between a male physician and a female physician not running through the whole nature like the difference between a physician and a carpenter
and if the difference of the sexes is only that the one beget and the other bear children this does not prove that they ought to have distinct educations
admitting that women differ from men in capacity do not men equally differ from one another
has not nature scattered all the qualities which our citizens require indifferently up and down among the two sexes
and even in their peculiar pursuits are not women often though in some cases superior to men ridiculously enough surpassed by them
women are the same in kind as men and have the same aptitude or want of aptitude for medicine or gymnastic or war but in a less degree
one woman will be a good guardian another not and the good must be chosen to be the colleagues of our guardians
if however their natures are the same the inference is that their education must also be the same there is no longer anything unnatural or impossible in a woman learning music and gymnastic
and the education which we give them will be the very best far superior to that of cobblers and will train up the very best women and nothing can be more advantageous to the state than this
therefore let them strip clothed in their chastity and share in the toils of war and in the defence of their country he who laughs at them is a fool for his pains
the first wave is past and the argument is compelled to admit that men and women have common duties and pursuits
a second and greater wave is rolling in community of wives and children is this either expedient or possible
the expediency i do not doubt i am not so sure of the possibility
nay i think that a considerable doubt will be entertained on both points
i meant to have escaped the trouble of proving the first but as you have detected the little stratagem i must even submit
only allow me to feed my fancy like the solitary in his walks with a dream of what might be and then i will return to the question of what can be
in the first place our rulers will enforce the laws and make new ones where they are wanted and their allies or ministers will obey
you as legislator have already selected the men and now you shall select the women
after the selection has been made they will dwell in common houses and have their meals in common and will be brought together by a necessity more certain than that of mathematics
but they cannot be allowed to live in licentiousness that is an unholy thing which the rulers are determined to prevent
for the avoidance of this holy marriage festivals will be instituted and their holiness will be in proportion to their usefulness
and here glaucon i should like to ask do you not take the greatest care in the mating
certainly
and there is no reason to suppose that less care is required in the marriage of human beings
but then our rulers must be skilful physicians of the state for they will often need a strong dose of falsehood in order to bring about desirable unions between their subjects
the good must be paired with the good and the bad with the bad and the offspring of the one must be reared and of the other destroyed in this way the flock will be preserved in prime condition
hymeneal festivals will be celebrated at times fixed with an eye to population and the brides and bridegrooms will meet at them and by an ingenious system of lots the rulers will contrive that the brave and the fair come together and that those of inferior breed are paired with inferiors the latter will ascribe to chance what is really the invention of the rulers
and when children are born the offspring of the brave and fair will be carried to an enclosure in a certain part of the city and there attended by suitable nurses the rest will be hurried away to places unknown
the mothers will be brought to the fold and will suckle the children care however must be taken that none of them recognise their own offspring and if necessary other nurses may also be hired
the trouble of watching and getting up at night will be transferred to attendants
then the wives of our guardians will have a fine easy time when they are having children
and quite right too i said that they should
the parents ought to be in the prime of life which for a man may be reckoned at thirty years from twenty five when he has passed the point at which the speed of life is greatest to fifty five and at twenty years for a woman from twenty to forty
any one above or below those ages who partakes in the hymeneals shall be guilty of impiety also every one who forms a marriage connexion at other times without the consent of the rulers
this latter regulation applies to those who are within the specified ages after which they may range at will provided they avoid the prohibited degrees of parents and children or of brothers and sisters which last however are not absolutely prohibited if a dispensation be procured
but how shall we know the degrees of affinity when all things are common
the answer is that brothers and sisters are all such as are born seven or nine months after the espousals and their parents those who are then espoused and every one will have many children and every child many parents
socrates proceeds i have now to prove that this scheme is advantageous and also consistent with our entire polity
the greatest good of a state is unity the greatest evil discord and distraction
and there will be unity where there are no private pleasures or pains or interests where if one member suffers all the members suffer if one citizen is touched all are quickly sensitive and the least hurt to the little finger of the state runs through the whole body and vibrates to the soul
for the true state like an individual is injured as a whole when any part is affected
every state has subjects and rulers who in a democracy are called rulers and in other states masters but in our state they are called saviours and allies and the subjects who in other states are termed slaves are by us termed nurturers and paymasters and those who are termed comrades and colleagues in other places are by us called fathers and brothers
and whereas in other states members of the same government regard one of their colleagues as a friend and another as an enemy in our state no man is a stranger to another for every citizen is connected with every other by ties of blood and these names and this way of speaking will have a corresponding reality brother father sister mother repeated from infancy in the ears of children will not be mere words
then again the citizens will have all things in common in having common property they will have common pleasures and pains
can there be strife and contention among those who are of one mind or lawsuits about property when men have nothing but their bodies which they call their own or suits about violence when every one is bound to defend himself
the permission to strike when insulted will be an antidote to the knife and will prevent disturbances in the state
but no younger man will strike an elder reverence will prevent him from laying hands on his kindred and he will fear that the rest of the family may retaliate
moreover our citizens will be rid of the lesser evils of life there will be no flattery of the rich no sordid household cares no borrowing and not paying
compared with the citizens of other states ours will be olympic victors and crowned with blessings greater still they and their children having a better maintenance during life and after death an honourable burial
nor has the happiness of the individual been sacrificed to the happiness of the state our olympic victor has not been turned into a cobbler but he has a happiness beyond that of any cobbler
at the same time if any conceited youth begins to dream of appropriating the state to himself he must be reminded that half is better than the whole
i should certainly advise him to stay where he is when he has the promise of such a brave life
but is such a community possible
as among the animals so also among men and if possible in what way possible
about war there is no difficulty the principle of communism is adapted to military service
parents will take their children to look on at a battle just as potters boys are trained to the business by looking on at the wheel
and to the parents themselves as to other animals the sight of their young ones will prove a great incentive to bravery
young warriors must learn but they must not run into danger although a certain degree of risk is worth incurring when the benefit is great
the young creatures should be placed under the care of experienced veterans and they should have wings that is to say swift and tractable steeds on which they may fly away and escape
one of the first things to be done is to teach a youth to ride
cowards and deserters shall be degraded to the class of husbandmen gentlemen who allow themselves to be taken prisoners may be presented to the enemy
but what shall be done to the hero
first of all he shall be crowned by all the youths in the army secondly he shall receive the right hand of fellowship and thirdly do you think that there is any harm in his being kissed
we have already determined that he shall have more wives than others in order that he may have as many children as possible
and at a feast he shall have more to eat we have the authority of homer for honouring brave men with long chines which is an appropriate compliment because meat is a very strengthening thing
fill the bowl then and give the best seats and meats to the brave may they do them good
and he who dies in battle will be at once declared to be of the golden race and will as we believe become one of hesiod s guardian angels
he shall be worshipped after death in the manner prescribed by the oracle and not only he but all other benefactors of the state who die in any other way shall be admitted to the same honours
the next question is how shall we treat our enemies
shall hellenes be enslaved
no for there is too great a risk of the whole race passing under the yoke of the barbarians
or shall the dead be despoiled
certainly not for that sort of thing is an excuse for skulking and has been the ruin of many an army
there is meanness and feminine malice in making an enemy of the dead body when the soul which was the owner has fled like a dog who cannot reach his assailants and quarrels with the stones which are thrown at him instead
again the arms of hellenes should not be offered up in the temples of the gods they are a pollution for they are taken from brethren
and on similar grounds there should be a limit to the devastation of hellenic territory the houses should not be burnt nor more than the annual produce carried off
for war is of two kinds civil and foreign the first of which is properly termed discord and only the second war and war between hellenes is in reality civil war a quarrel in a family which is ever to be regarded as unpatriotic and unnatural and ought to be prosecuted with a view to reconciliation in a true phil hellenic spirit as of those who would chasten but not utterly enslave
the war is not against a whole nation who are a friendly multitude of men women and children but only against a few guilty persons when they are punished peace will be restored
that is the way in which hellenes should war against one another and against barbarians as they war against one another now
but my dear socrates you are forgetting the main question is such a state possible
i grant all and more than you say about the blessedness of being one family fathers brothers mothers daughters going out to war together but i want to ascertain the possibility of this ideal state
you are too unmerciful
the first wave and the second wave i have hardly escaped and now you will certainly drown me with the third
when you see the towering crest of the wave i expect you to take pity
not a whit
well then we were led to form our ideal polity in the search after justice and the just man answered to the just state
is this ideal at all the worse for being impracticable
would the picture of a perfectly beautiful man be any the worse because no such man ever lived
can any reality come up to the idea
nature will not allow words to be fully realized but if i am to try and realize the ideal of the state in a measure i think that an approach may be made to the perfection of which i dream by one or two i do not say slight but possible changes in the present constitution of states
i would reduce them to a single one the great wave as i call it
until then kings are philosophers or philosophers are kings cities will never cease from ill no nor the human race nor will our ideal polity ever come into being
i know that this is a hard saying which few will be able to receive
socrates all the world will take off his coat and rush upon you with sticks and stones and therefore i would advise you to prepare an answer
you got me into the scrape i said
and i was right he replied however i will stand by you as a sort of do nothing well meaning ally
having the help of such a champion i will do my best to maintain my position
and first i must explain of whom i speak and what sort of natures these are who are to be philosophers and rulers
as you are a man of pleasure you will not have forgotten how indiscriminate lovers are in their attachments they love all and turn blemishes into beauties
the snub nosed youth is said to have a winning grace the beak of another has a royal look the featureless are faultless the dark are manly the fair angels the sickly have a new term of endearment invented expressly for them which is honey pale
lovers of wine and lovers of ambition also desire the objects of their affection in every form
now here comes the point the philosopher too is a lover of knowledge in every form he has an insatiable curiosity
but will curiosity make a philosopher
are the lovers of sights and sounds who let out their ears to every chorus at the dionysiac festivals to be called philosophers
they are not true philosophers but only an imitation
then how are we to describe the true
you would acknowledge the existence of abstract ideas such as justice beauty good evil which are severally one yet in their various combinations appear to be many
those who recognize these realities are philosophers whereas the other class hear sounds and see colours and understand their use in the arts but cannot attain to the true or waking vision of absolute justice or beauty or truth they have not the light of knowledge but of opinion and what they see is a dream only
perhaps he of whom we say the last will be angry with us can we pacify him without revealing the disorder of his mind
suppose we say that if he has knowledge we rejoice to hear it but knowledge must be of something which is as ignorance is of something which is not and there is a third thing which both is and is not and is matter of opinion only
opinion and knowledge then having distinct objects must also be distinct faculties
and by faculties i mean powers unseen and distinguishable only by the difference in their objects as opinion and knowledge differ since the one is liable to err but the other is unerring and is the mightiest of all our faculties
if being is the object of knowledge and not being of ignorance and these are the extremes opinion must lie between them and may be called darker than the one and brighter than the other
this intermediate or contingent matter is and is not at the same time and partakes both of existence and of non existence
now i would ask my good friend who denies abstract beauty and justice and affirms a many beautiful and a many just whether everything he sees is not in some point of view different the beautiful ugly the pious impious the just unjust
is not the double also the half and are not heavy and light relative terms which pass into one another
everything is and is not as in the old riddle a man and not a man shot and did not shoot a bird and not a bird with a stone and not a stone
the mind cannot be fixed on either alternative and these ambiguous intermediate erring half lighted objects which have a disorderly movement in the region between being and not being are the proper matter of opinion as the immutable objects are the proper matter of knowledge
and he who grovels in the world of sense and has only this uncertain perception of things is not a philosopher but a lover of opinion only
the fifth book is the new beginning of the republic in which the community of property and of family are first maintained and the transition is made to the kingdom of philosophers
for both of these plato after his manner has been preparing in some chance words of book iv which fall unperceived on the reader s mind as they are supposed at first to have fallen on the ear of glaucon and adeimantus
the paradoxes as morgenstern terms them of this book of the republic will be reserved for another place a few remarks on the style and some explanations of difficulties may be briefly added
first there is the image of the waves which serves for a sort of scheme or plan of the book
the first wave the second wave the third and greatest wave come rolling in and we hear the roar of them
all that can be said of the extravagance of plato s proposals is anticipated by himself
nothing is more admirable than the hesitation with which he proposes the solemn text until kings are philosophers etc
or the reaction from the sublime to the ridiculous when glaucon describes the manner in which the new truth will be received by mankind
some defects and difficulties may be noted in the execution of the communistic plan
nothing is told us of the application of communism to the lower classes nor is the table of prohibited degrees capable of being made out
it is quite possible that a child born at one hymeneal festival may marry one of its own brothers or sisters or even one of its parents at another
plato is afraid of incestuous unions but at the same time he does not wish to bring before us the fact that the city would be divided into families of those born seven and nine months after each hymeneal festival
if it were worth while to argue seriously about such fancies we might remark that while all the old affinities are abolished the newly prohibited affinity rests not on any natural or rational principle but only upon the accident of children having been born in the same month and year
nor does he explain how the lots could be so manipulated by the legislature as to bring together the fairest and best
the singular expression which is employed to describe the age of five and twenty may perhaps be taken from some poet
in the delineation of the philosopher the illustrations of the nature of philosophy derived from love are more suited to the apprehension of glaucon the athenian man of pleasure than to modern tastes or feelings
they are partly facetious but also contain a germ of truth
that science is a whole remains a true principle of inductive as well as of metaphysical philosophy and the love of universal knowledge is still the characteristic of the philosopher in modern as well as in ancient times
at the end of the fifth book plato introduces the figment of contingent matter which has exercised so great an influence both on the ethics and theology of the modern world and which occurs here for the first time in the history of philosophy
he did not remark that the degrees of knowledge in the subject have nothing corresponding to them in the object
with him a word must answer to an idea and he could not conceive of an opinion which was an opinion about nothing
the influence of analogy led him to invent parallels and conjugates and to overlook facts
to us some of his difficulties are puzzling only from their simplicity we do not perceive that the answer to them is tumbling out at our feet
to the mind of early thinkers the conception of not being was dark and mysterious they did not see that this terrible apparition which threatened destruction to all knowledge was only a logical determination
the common term under which through the accidental use of language two entirely different ideas were included was another source of confusion
thus through the ambiguity of plato attempting to introduce order into the first chaos of human thought seems to have confused perception and opinion and to have failed to distinguish the contingent from the relative
in the theaetetus the first of these difficulties begins to clear up in the sophist the second and for this as well as for other reasons both these dialogues are probably to be regarded as later than the republic
book vi
having determined that the many have no knowledge of true being and have no clear patterns in their minds of justice beauty truth and that philosophers have such patterns we have now to ask whether they or the many shall be rulers in our state
but who can doubt that philosophers should be chosen if they have the other qualities which are required in a ruler
for they are lovers of the knowledge of the eternal and of all truth they are haters of falsehood their meaner desires are absorbed in the interests of knowledge they are spectators of all time and all existence and in the magnificence of their contemplation the life of man is as nothing to them nor is death fearful
also they are of a social gracious disposition equally free from cowardice and arrogance
they learn and remember easily they have harmonious well regulated minds truth flows to them sweetly by nature
can the god of jealousy himself find any fault with such an assemblage of good qualities
here adeimantus interposes no man can answer you socrates but every man feels that this is owing to his own deficiency in argument
he is driven from one position to another until he has nothing more to say just as an unskilful player at draughts is reduced to his last move by a more skilled opponent
and yet all the time he may be right
he may know in this very instance that those who make philosophy the business of their lives generally turn out rogues if they are bad men and fools if they are good
what do you say
i should say that he is quite right
then how is such an admission reconcileable with the doctrine that philosophers should be kings
i shall answer you in a parable which will also let you see how poor a hand i am at the invention of allegories
the relation of good men to their governments is so peculiar that in order to defend them i must take an illustration from the world of fiction
conceive the captain of a ship taller by a head and shoulders than any of the crew yet a little deaf a little blind and rather ignorant of the seaman s art
the sailors want to steer although they know nothing of the art and they have a theory that it cannot be learned
if the helm is refused them they drug the captain s posset bind him hand and foot and take possession of the ship
he who joins in the mutiny is termed a good pilot and what not they have no conception that the true pilot must observe the winds and the stars and must be their master whether they like it or not such an one would be called by them fool prater star gazer
this is my parable which i will beg you to interpret for me to those gentlemen who ask why the philosopher has such an evil name and to explain to them that not he but those who will not use him are to blame for his uselessness
the philosopher should not beg of mankind to be put in authority over them
the wise man should not seek the rich as the proverb bids but every man whether rich or poor must knock at the door of the physician when he has need of him
now the pilot is the philosopher he whom in the parable they call star gazer and the mutinous sailors are the mob of politicians by whom he is rendered useless
not that these are the worst enemies of philosophy who is far more dishonoured by her own professing sons when they are corrupted by the world
need i recall the original image of the philosopher
did we not say of him just now that he loved truth and hated falsehood and that he could not rest in the multiplicity of phenomena but was led by a sympathy in his own nature to the contemplation of the absolute
all the virtues as well as truth who is the leader of them took up their abode in his soul
but as you were observing if we turn aside to view the reality we see that the persons who were thus described with the exception of a small and useless class are utter rogues
the point which has to be considered is the origin of this corruption in nature
every one will admit that the philosopher in our description of him is a rare being
but what numberless causes tend to destroy these rare beings
there is no good thing which may not be a cause of evil health wealth strength rank and the virtues themselves when placed under unfavourable circumstances
for as in the animal or vegetable world the strongest seeds most need the accompaniment of good air and soil so the best of human characters turn out the worst when they fall upon an unsuitable soil whereas weak natures hardly ever do any considerable good or harm they are not the stuff out of which either great criminals or great heroes are made
the philosopher follows the same analogy he is either the best or the worst of all men
some persons say that the sophists are the corrupters of youth but is not public opinion the real sophist who is everywhere present in those very persons in the assembly in the courts in the camp in the applauses and hisses of the theatre re echoed by the surrounding hills
will not a young man s heart leap amid these discordant sounds
and will any education save him from being carried away by the torrent
nor is this all
for if he will not yield to opinion there follows the gentle compulsion of exile or death
what principle of rival sophists or anybody else can overcome in such an unequal contest
characters there may be more than human who are exceptions god may save a man but not his own strength
further i would have you consider that the hireling sophist only gives back to the world their own opinions he is the keeper of the monster who knows how to flatter or anger him and observes the meaning of his inarticulate grunts
good is what pleases him evil what he dislikes truth and beauty are determined only by the taste of the brute
such is the sophist s wisdom and such is the condition of those who make public opinion the test of truth whether in art or in morals
the curse is laid upon them of being and doing what it approves and when they attempt first principles the failure is ludicrous
think of all this and ask yourself whether the world is more likely to be a believer in the unity of the idea or in the multiplicity of phenomena
and the world if not a believer in the idea cannot be a philosopher and must therefore be a persecutor of philosophers
there is another evil the world does not like to lose the gifted nature and so they flatter the young into a magnificent opinion of his own capacity the tall proper youth begins to expand and is dreaming of kingdoms and empires
if at this instant a friend whispers to him now the gods lighten thee thou art a great fool and must be educated do you think that he will listen
or suppose a better sort of man who is attracted towards philosophy will they not make herculean efforts to spoil and corrupt him
are we not right in saying that the love of knowledge no less than riches may divert him
men of this class often become politicians they are the authors of great mischief in states and sometimes also of great good
and thus philosophy is deserted by her natural protectors and others enter in and dishonour her
vulgar little minds see the land open and rush from the prisons of the arts into her temple
a clever mechanic having a soul coarse as his body thinks that he will gain caste by becoming her suitor
for philosophy even in her fallen estate has a dignity of her own and he like a bald little blacksmith s apprentice as he is having made some money and got out of durance washes and dresses himself as a bridegroom and marries his master s daughter
what will be the issue of such marriages
will they not be vile and bastard devoid of truth and nature
they will
small then is the remnant of genuine philosophers there may be a few who are citizens of small states in which politics are not worth thinking of or who have been detained by theages bridle of ill health for my own case of the oracular sign is almost unique and too rare to be worth mentioning
and these few when they have tasted the pleasures of philosophy and have taken a look at that den of thieves and place of wild beasts which is human life will stand aside from the storm under the shelter of a wall and try to preserve their own innocence and to depart in peace
a great work too will have been accomplished by them
great yes but not the greatest for man is a social being and can only attain his highest development in the society which is best suited to him
enough then of the causes why philosophy has such an evil name
another question is which of existing states is suited to her
not one of them at present she is like some exotic seed which degenerates in a strange soil only in her proper state will she be shown to be of heavenly growth
and is her proper state ours or some other
ours in all points but one which was left undetermined
you may remember our saying that some living mind or witness of the legislator was needed in states
but we were afraid to enter upon a subject of such difficulty and now the question recurs and has not grown easier how may philosophy be safely studied
let us bring her into the light of day and make an end of the inquiry
in the first place i say boldly that nothing can be worse than the present mode of study
persons usually pick up a little philosophy in early youth and in the intervals of business but they never master the real difficulty which is dialectic
later perhaps they occasionally go to a lecture on philosophy
years advance and the sun of philosophy unlike that of heracleitus sets never to rise again
this order of education should be reversed it should begin with gymnastics in youth and as the man strengthens he should increase the gymnastics of his soul
then when active life is over let him finally return to philosophy
you are in earnest socrates but the world will be equally earnest in withstanding you no more than thrasymachus
do not make a quarrel between thrasymachus and me who were never enemies and are now good friends enough
and i shall do my best to convince him and all mankind of the truth of my words or at any rate to prepare for the future when in another life we may again take part in similar discussions
that will be a long time hence
not long in comparison with eternity
the many will probably remain incredulous for they have never seen the natural unity of ideas but only artificial juxtapositions not free and generous thoughts but tricks of controversy and quips of law a perfect man ruling in a perfect state even a single one they have not known
and we foresaw that there was no chance of perfection either in states or individuals until a necessity was laid upon philosophers not the rogues but those whom we called the useless class of holding office or until the sons of kings were inspired with a true love of philosophy
whether in the infinity of past time there has been or is in some distant land or ever will be hereafter an ideal such as we have described we stoutly maintain that there has been is and will be such a state whenever the muse of philosophy rules
will you say that the world is of another mind
o my friend do not revile the world
they will soon change their opinion if they are gently entreated and are taught the true nature of the philosopher
who can hate a man who loves him
or be jealous of one who has no jealousy
consider again that the many hate not the true but the false philosophers the pretenders who force their way in without invitation and are always speaking of persons and not of principles which is unlike the spirit of philosophy
for the true philosopher despises earthly strife his eye is fixed on the eternal order in accordance with which he moulds himself into the divine image and is the creator of the virtues private as well as public
when mankind see that the happiness of states is only to be found in that image will they be angry with us for attempting to delineate it
certainly not
but what will be the process of delineation
the artist will do nothing until he has made a tabula rasa on this he will inscribe the constitution of a state glancing often at the divine truth of nature and from that deriving the godlike among men mingling the two elements rubbing out and painting in until there is a perfect harmony or fusion of the divine and human
but perhaps the world will doubt the existence of such an artist
what will they doubt
that the philosopher is a lover of truth having a nature akin to the best
and if they admit this will they still quarrel with us for making philosophers our kings
they will be less disposed to quarrel
let us assume then that they are pacified
still a person may hesitate about the probability of the son of a king being a philosopher
and we do not deny that they are very liable to be corrupted but yet surely in the course of ages there might be one exception and one is enough
if one son of a king were a philosopher and had obedient citizens he might bring the ideal polity into being
hence we conclude that our laws are not only the best but that they are also possible though not free from difficulty
i gained nothing by evading the troublesome questions which arose concerning women and children
i will be wiser now and acknowledge that we must go to the bottom of another question what is to be the education of our guardians
it was agreed that they were to be lovers of their country and were to be tested in the refiner s fire of pleasures and pains and those who came forth pure and remained fixed in their principles were to have honours and rewards in life and after death
but at this point the argument put on her veil and turned into another path
i hesitated to make the assertion which i now hazard that our guardians must be philosophers
you remember all the contradictory elements which met in the philosopher how difficult to find them all in a single person
intelligence and spirit are not often combined with steadiness the stolid fearless nature is averse to intellectual toil
and yet these opposite elements are all necessary and therefore as we were saying before the aspirant must be tested in pleasures and dangers and also as we must now further add in the highest branches of knowledge
you will remember that when we spoke of the virtues mention was made of a longer road which you were satisfied to leave unexplored
enough seemed to have been said
enough my friend but what is enough while anything remains wanting
of all men the guardian must not faint in the search after truth he must be prepared to take the longer road or he will never reach that higher region which is above the four virtues and of the virtues too he must not only get an outline but a clear and distinct vision
and what are the highest
you to pretend unconsciousness when you have so often heard me speak of the idea of good about which we know so little and without which though a man gain the world he has no profit of it
some people imagine that the good is wisdom but this involves a circle the good they say is wisdom wisdom has to do with the good
according to others the good is pleasure but then comes the absurdity that good is bad for there are bad pleasures as well as good
again the good must have reality a man may desire the appearance of virtue but he will not desire the appearance of good
ought our guardians then to be ignorant of this supreme principle of which every man has a presentiment and without which no man has any real knowledge of anything
but socrates what is this supreme principle knowledge or pleasure or what
you may think me troublesome but i say that you have no business to be always repeating the doctrines of others instead of giving us your own
can i say what i do not know
you may offer an opinion
and will the blindness and crookedness of opinion content you when you might have the light and certainty of science
i will only ask you to give such an explanation of the good as you have given already of temperance and justice
i wish that i could but in my present mood i cannot reach to the height of the knowledge of the good
to the parent or principal i cannot introduce you but to the child begotten in his image which i may compare with the interest on the principal i will
you remember our old distinction of the many beautiful and the one beautiful the particular and the universal the objects of sight and the objects of thought
did you ever consider that the objects of sight imply a faculty of sight which is the most complex and costly of our senses requiring not only objects of sense but also a medium which is light without which the sight will not distinguish between colours and all will be a blank
for light is the noble bond between the perceiving faculty and the thing perceived and the god who gives us light is the sun who is the eye of the day but is not to be confounded with the eye of man
this eye of the day or sun is what i call the child of the good standing in the same relation to the visible world as the good to the intellectual
when the sun shines the eye sees and in the intellectual world where truth is there is sight and light
now that which is the sun of intelligent natures is the idea of good the cause of knowledge and truth yet other and fairer than they are and standing in the same relation to them in which the sun stands to light
o inconceivable height of beauty which is above knowledge and above truth
and this idea of good like the sun is also the cause of growth and the author not of knowledge only but of being yet greater far than either in dignity and power
that is a reach of thought more than human but pray go on with the image for i suspect that there is more behind
there is i said and bearing in mind our two suns or principles imagine further their corresponding worlds one of the visible the other of the intelligible you may assist your fancy by figuring the distinction under the image of a line divided into two unequal parts and may again subdivide each part into two lesser segments representative of the stages of knowledge in either sphere
the lower portion of the lower or visible sphere will consist of shadows and reflections and its upper and smaller portion will contain real objects in the world of nature or of art
the sphere of the intelligible will also have two divisions one of mathematics in which there is no ascent but all is descent no inquiring into premises but only drawing of inferences
in this division the mind works with figures and numbers the images of which are taken not from the shadows but from the objects although the truth of them is seen only with the mind s eye and they are used as hypotheses without being analysed
whereas in the other division reason uses the hypotheses as stages or steps in the ascent to the idea of good to which she fastens them and then again descends walking firmly in the region of ideas and of ideas only in her ascent as well as descent and finally resting in them
i partly understand he replied you mean that the ideas of science are superior to the hypothetical metaphorical conceptions of geometry and the other arts or sciences whichever is to be the name of them and the latter conceptions you refuse to make subjects of pure intellect because they have no first principle although when resting on a first principle they pass into the higher sphere
you understand me very well i said
and now to those four divisions of knowledge you may assign four corresponding faculties pure intelligence to the highest sphere active intelligence to the second to the third faith to the fourth the perception of shadows and the clearness of the several faculties will be in the same ratio as the truth of the objects to which they are related
like socrates we may recapitulate the virtues of the philosopher
in language which seems to reach beyond the horizon of that age and country he is described as the spectator of all time and all existence
he has the noblest gifts of nature and makes the highest use of them
all his desires are absorbed in the love of wisdom which is the love of truth
none of the graces of a beautiful soul are wanting in him neither can he fear death or think much of human life
the ideal of modern times hardly retains the simplicity of the antique there is not the same originality either in truth or error which characterized the greeks
the philosopher is no longer living in the unseen nor is he sent by an oracle to convince mankind of ignorance nor does he regard knowledge as a system of ideas leading upwards by regular stages to the idea of good
the eagerness of the pursuit has abated there is more division of labour and less of comprehensive reflection upon nature and human life as a whole more of exact observation and less of anticipation and inspiration
still in the altered conditions of knowledge the parallel is not wholly lost and there may be a use in translating the conception of plato into the language of our own age
the philosopher in modern times is one who fixes his mind on the laws of nature in their sequence and connexion not on fragments or pictures of nature on history not on controversy on the truths which are acknowledged by the few not on the opinions of the many
he is aware of the importance of classifying according to nature and will try to separate the limbs of science without breaking them 
there is no part of truth whether great or small which he will dishonour and in the least things he will discern the greatest 
like the ancient philosopher he sees the world pervaded by analogies but he can also tell why in some cases a single instance is sufficient for an induction while in other cases a thousand examples would prove nothing
he inquires into a portion of knowledge only because the whole has grown too vast to be embraced by a single mind or life
he has a clearer conception of the divisions of science and of their relation to the mind of man than was possible to the ancients
like plato he has a vision of the unity of knowledge not as the beginning of philosophy to be attained by a study of elementary mathematics but as the far off result of the working of many minds in many ages
he is aware that mathematical studies are preliminary to almost every other at the same time he will not reduce all varieties of knowledge to the type of mathematics
he too must have a nobility of character without which genius loses the better half of greatness
regarding the world as a point in immensity and each individual as a link in a never ending chain of existence he will not think much of his own life or be greatly afraid of death
adeimantus objects first of all to the form of the socratic reasoning thus showing that plato is aware of the imperfection of his own method
he brings the accusation against himself which might be brought against him by a modern logician that he extracts the answer because he knows how to put the question
in a long argument words are apt to change their meaning slightly or premises may be assumed or conclusions inferred with rather too much certainty or universality the variation at each step may be unobserved and yet at last the divergence becomes considerable
hence the failure of attempts to apply arithmetical or algebraic formulae to logic
the imperfection or rather the higher and more elastic nature of language does not allow words to have the precision of numbers or of symbols
and this quality in language impairs the force of an argument which has many steps
the objection though fairly met by socrates in this particular instance may be regarded as implying a reflection upon the socratic mode of reasoning
and here as elsewhere plato seems to intimate that the time had come when the negative and interrogative method of socrates must be superseded by a positive and constructive one of which examples are given in some of the later dialogues
adeimantus further argues that the ideal is wholly at variance with facts for experience proves philosophers to be either useless or rogues
contrary to all expectation socrates has no hesitation in admitting the truth of this and explains the anomaly in an allegory first characteristically depreciating his own inventive powers
in this allegory the people are distinguished from the professional politicians and as elsewhere are spoken of in a tone of pity rather than of censure under the image of the noble captain who is not very quick in his perceptions
the uselessness of philosophers is explained by the circumstance that mankind will not use them
the world in all ages has been divided between contempt and fear of those who employ the power of ideas and know no other weapons
concerning the false philosopher socrates argues that the best is most liable to corruption and that the finer nature is more likely to suffer from alien conditions
we too observe that there are some kinds of excellence which spring from a peculiar delicacy of constitution as is evidently true of the poetical and imaginative temperament which often seems to depend on impressions and hence can only breathe or live in a certain atmosphere
the man of genius has greater pains and greater pleasures greater powers and greater weaknesses and often a greater play of character than is to be found in ordinary men
he can assume the disguise of virtue or disinterestedness without having them or veil personal enmity in the language of patriotism and philosophy he can say the word which all men are thinking he has an insight which is terrible into the follies and weaknesses of his fellow men
an alcibiades a mirabeau or a napoleon the first are born either to be the authors of great evils in states or of great good when they are drawn in that direction
yet the thesis corruptio optimi pessima cannot be maintained generally or without regard to the kind of excellence which is corrupted
the alien conditions which are corrupting to one nature may be the elements of culture to another
in general a man can only receive his highest development in a congenial state or family among friends or fellow workers
but also he may sometimes be stirred by adverse circumstances to such a degree that he rises up against them and reforms them
and while weaker or coarser characters will extract good out of evil say in a corrupt state of the church or of society and live on happily allowing the evil to remain the finer or stronger natures may be crushed or spoiled by surrounding influences may become misanthrope and philanthrope by turns or in a few instances like the founders of the monastic orders or the reformers owing to some peculiarity in themselves or in their age may break away entirely from the world and from the church sometimes into great good sometimes into great evil sometimes into both
and the same holds in the lesser sphere of a convent a school a family
plato would have us consider how easily the best natures are overpowered by public opinion and what efforts the rest of mankind will make to get possession of them
the world the church their own profession any political or party organization are always carrying them off their legs and teaching them to apply high and holy names to their own prejudices and interests
the monster corporation to which they belong judges right and truth to be the pleasure of the community
the individual becomes one with his order or if he resists the world is too much for him and will sooner or later be revenged on him
this is perhaps a one sided but not wholly untrue picture of the maxims and practice of mankind when they sit down together at an assembly either in ancient or modern times
when the higher natures are corrupted by politics the lower take possession of the vacant place of philosophy
this is described in one of those continuous images in which the argument to use a platonic expression veils herself and which is dropped and reappears at intervals
the question is asked why are the citizens of states so hostile to philosophy
the answer is that they do not know her
and yet there is also a better mind of the many they would believe if they were taught
but hitherto they have only known a conventional imitation of philosophy words without thoughts systems which have no life in them a person uttering the words of beauty and freedom the friend of man holding communion with the eternal and seeking to frame the state in that image they have never known
the same double feeling respecting the mass of mankind has always existed among men
the first thought is that the people are the enemies of truth and right the second that this only arises out of an accidental error and confusion and that they do not really hate those who love them if they could be educated to know them
in the latter part of the sixth book three questions have to be considered 1st the nature of the longer and more circuitous way which is contrasted with the shorter and more imperfect method of book iv 2nd the heavenly pattern or idea of the state 3rd the relation of the divisions of knowledge to one another and to the corresponding faculties of the soul 1
of the higher method of knowledge in plato we have only a glimpse
neither here nor in the phaedrus or symposium nor yet in the philebus or sophist does he give any clear explanation of his meaning
he would probably have described his method as proceeding by regular steps to a system of universal knowledge which inferred the parts from the whole rather than the whole from the parts
this ideal logic is not practised by him in the search after justice or in the analysis of the parts of the soul there like aristotle in the nicomachean ethics he argues from experience and the common use of language
but at the end of the sixth book he conceives another and more perfect method in which all ideas are only steps or grades or moments of thought forming a connected whole which is self supporting and in which consistency is the test of truth
he does not explain to us in detail the nature of the process
like many other thinkers both in ancient and modern times his mind seems to be filled with a vacant form which he is unable to realize
he supposes the sciences to have a natural order and connexion in an age when they can hardly be said to exist
he is hastening on to the end of the intellectual world without even making a beginning of them
in modern times we hardly need to be reminded that the process of acquiring knowledge is here confused with the contemplation of absolute knowledge
in all science a priori and a posteriori truths mingle in various proportions
the a priori part is that which is derived from the most universal experience of men or is universally accepted by them the a posteriori is that which grows up around the more general principles and becomes imperceptibly one with them
but plato erroneously imagines that the synthesis is separable from the analysis and that the method of science can anticipate science
in entertaining such a vision of a priori knowledge he is sufficiently justified or at least his meaning may be sufficiently explained by the similar attempts of descartes kant hegel and even of bacon himself in modern philosophy
anticipations or divinations or prophetic glimpses of truths whether concerning man or nature seem to stand in the same relation to ancient philosophy which hypotheses bear to modern inductive science
these guesses at truth were not made at random they arose from a superficial impression of uniformities and first principles in nature which the genius of the greek contemplating the expanse of heaven and earth seemed to recognize in the distance
nor can we deny that in ancient times knowledge must have stood still and the human mind been deprived of the very instruments of thought if philosophy had been strictly confined to the results of experience
2
plato supposes that when the tablet has been made blank the artist will fill in the lineaments of the ideal state
is this a pattern laid up in heaven or mere vacancy on which he is supposed to gaze with wondering eye
the answer is that such ideals are framed partly by the omission of particulars partly by imagination perfecting the form which experience supplies 
plato represents these ideals in a figure as belonging to another world and in modern times the idea will sometimes seem to precede at other times to co operate with the hand of the artist
as in science so also in creative art there is a synthetical as well as an analytical method
one man will have the whole in his mind before he begins to another the processes of mind and hand will be simultaneous
3
there is no difficulty in seeing that plato s divisions of knowledge are based first on the fundamental antithesis of sensible and intellectual which pervades the whole pre socratic philosophy in which is implied also the opposition of the permanent and transient of the universal and particular
but the age of philosophy in which he lived seemed to require a further distinction numbers and figures were beginning to separate from ideas
the world could no longer regard justice as a cube and was learning to see though imperfectly that the abstractions of sense were distinct from the abstractions of mind
between the eleatic being or essence and the shadows of phenomena the pythagorean principle of number found a place and was as aristotle remarks a conducting medium from one to the other
hence plato is led to introduce a third term which had not hitherto entered into the scheme of his philosophy
he had observed the use of mathematics in education they were the best preparation for higher studies
the subjective relation between them further suggested an objective one although the passage from one to the other is really imaginary 
for metaphysical and moral philosophy has no connexion with mathematics number and figure are the abstractions of time and space not the expressions of purely intellectual conceptions
when divested of metaphor a straight line or a square has no more to do with right and justice than a crooked line with vice
the figurative association was mistaken for a real one and thus the three latter divisions of the platonic proportion were constructed
there is more difficulty in comprehending how he arrived at the first term of the series which is nowhere else mentioned and has no reference to any other part of his system
nor indeed does the relation of shadows to objects correspond to the relation of numbers to ideas
probably plato has been led by the love of analogy to make four terms instead of three although the objects perceived in both divisions of the lower sphere are equally objects of sense
he is also preparing the way as his manner is for the shadows of images at the beginning of the seventh book and the imitation of an imitation in the tenth
the line may be regarded as reaching from unity to infinity and is divided into two unequal parts and subdivided into two more each lower sphere is the multiplication of the preceding
of the four faculties faith in the lower division has an intermediate position timaeus contrasting equally with the vagueness of the perception of shadows and the higher certainty of understanding and reason 
the difference between understanding and mind or reason is analogous to the difference between acquiring knowledge in the parts and the contemplation of the whole
true knowledge is a whole and is at rest consistency and universality are the tests of truth
to this self evidencing knowledge of the whole the faculty of mind is supposed to correspond
but there is a knowledge of the understanding which is incomplete and in motion always because unable to rest in the subordinate ideas
those ideas are called both images and hypotheses images because they are clothed in sense hypotheses because they are assumptions only until they are brought into connexion with the idea of good
the general meaning of the passage noble then is the bond which links together sight.and of this kind i spoke as the intelligible
so far as the thought contained in it admits of being translated into the terms of modern philosophy may be described or explained as follows there is a truth one and self existent to which by the help of a ladder let down from above the human intelligence may ascend
this unity is like the sun in the heavens the light by which all things are seen the being by which they are created and sustained
it is the idea of good
and the steps of the ladder leading up to this highest or universal existence are the mathematical sciences which also contain in themselves an element of the universal
these too we see in a new manner when we connect them with the idea of good
they then cease to be hypotheses or pictures and become essential parts of a higher truth which is at once their first principle and their final cause
we cannot give any more precise meaning to this remarkable passage but we may trace in it several rudiments or vestiges of thought which are common to us and to plato such as the unity and correlation of the sciences or rather of science for in plato s time they were not yet parted off or distinguished the existence of a divine power or life or idea or cause or reason not yet conceived or no longer conceived as in the timaeus and elsewhere under the form of a person the recognition of the hypothetical and conditional character of the mathematical sciences and in a measure of every science when isolated from the rest the conviction of a truth which is invisible and of a law though hardly a law of nature which permeates the intellectual rather than the visible world
the method of socrates is hesitating and tentative awaiting the fuller explanation of the idea of good and of the nature of dialectic in the seventh book
the imperfect intelligence of glaucon and the reluctance of socrates to make a beginning mark the difficulty of the subject
the allusion to theages bridle and to the internal oracle or demonic sign of socrates which here as always in plato is only prohibitory the remark that the salvation of any remnant of good in the present evil state of the world is due to god only the reference to a future state of existence which is unknown to glaucon in the tenth book and in which the discussions of socrates and his disciples would be resumed the surprise in the answers the fanciful irony of socrates where he pretends that he can only describe the strange position of the philosopher in a figure of speech the original observation that the sophists after all are only the representatives and not the leaders of public opinion the picture of the philosopher standing aside in the shower of sleet under a wall the figure of the great beast followed by the expression of good will towards the common people who would not have rejected the philosopher if they had known him the right noble thought that the highest truths demand the greatest exactness the hesitation of socrates in returning once more to his well worn theme of the idea of good the ludicrous earnestness of glaucon the comparison of philosophy to a deserted maiden who marries beneath her are some of the most interesting characteristics of the sixth book
yet a few more words may be added on the old theme which was so oft discussed in the socratic circle of which we like glaucon and adeimantus would fain if possible have a clearer notion
like them we are dissatisfied when we are told that the idea of good can only be revealed to a student of the mathematical sciences and we are inclined to think that neither we nor they could have been led along that path to any satisfactory goal
for we have learned that differences of quantity cannot pass into differences of quality and that the mathematical sciences can never rise above themselves into the sphere of our higher thoughts although they may sometimes furnish symbols and expressions of them and may train the mind in habits of abstraction and self concentration
the illusion which was natural to an ancient philosopher has ceased to be an illusion to us
but if the process by which we are supposed to arrive at the idea of good be really imaginary may not the idea itself be also a mere abstraction
we remark first that in all ages and especially in primitive philosophy words such as being essence unity good have exerted an extraordinary influence over the minds of men
the meagreness or negativeness of their content has been in an inverse ratio to their power
they have become the forms under which all things were comprehended
there was a need or instinct in the human soul which they satisfied they were not ideas but gods and to this new mythology the men of a later generation began to attach the powers and associations of the elder deities
the idea of good is one of those sacred words or forms of thought which were beginning to take the place of the old mythology
it meant unity in which all time and all existence were gathered up
it was the truth of all things and also the light in which they shone forth and became evident to intelligences human and divine
it was the cause of all things the power by which they were brought into being
it was the universal reason divested of a human personality
it was the life as well as the light of the world all knowledge and all power were comprehended in it
the way to it was through the mathematical sciences and these too were dependent on it
to ask whether god was the maker of it or made by it would be like asking whether god could be conceived apart from goodness or goodness apart from god
the god of the timaeus is not really at variance with the idea of good they are aspects of the same differing only as the personal from the impersonal or the masculine from the neuter the one being the expression or language of mythology the other of philosophy
this or something like this is the meaning of the idea of good as conceived by plato
ideas of number order harmony development may also be said to enter into it
the paraphrase which has just been given of it goes beyond the actual words of plato
we have perhaps arrived at the stage of philosophy which enables us to understand what he is aiming at better than he did himself
we are beginning to realize what he saw darkly and at a distance
but if he could have been told that this or some conception of the same kind but higher than this was the truth at which he was aiming and the need which he sought to supply he would gladly have recognized that more was contained in his own thoughts than he himself knew
as his words are few and his manner reticent and tentative so must the style of his interpreter be
we should not approach his meaning more nearly by attempting to define it further
in translating him into the language of modern thought we might insensibly lose the spirit of ancient philosophy
it is remarkable that although plato speaks of the idea of good as the first principle of truth and being it is nowhere mentioned in his writings except in this passage
nor did it retain any hold upon the minds of his disciples in a later generation it was probably unintelligible to them
nor does the mention of it in aristotle appear to have any reference to this or any other passage in his extant writings
book vii
and now i will describe in a figure the enlightenment or unenlightenment of our nature imagine human beings living in an underground den which is open towards the light they have been there from childhood having their necks and legs chained and can only see into the den
at a distance there is a fire and between the fire and the prisoners a raised way and a low wall is built along the way like the screen over which marionette players show their puppets
behind the wall appear moving figures who hold in their hands various works of art and among them images of men and animals wood and stone and some of the passers by are talking and others silent
a strange parable he said and strange captives
they are ourselves i replied and they see only the shadows of the images which the fire throws on the wall of the den to these they give names and if we add an echo which returns from the wall the voices of the passengers will seem to proceed from the shadows
suppose now that you suddenly turn them round and make them look with pain and grief to themselves at the real images will they believe them to be real
will not their eyes be dazzled and will they not try to get away from the light to something which they are able to behold without blinking
and suppose further that they are dragged up a steep and rugged ascent into the presence of the sun himself will not their sight be darkened with the excess of light
some time will pass before they get the habit of perceiving at all and at first they will be able to perceive only shadows and reflections in the water then they will recognize the moon and the stars and will at length behold the sun in his own proper place as he is
last of all they will conclude this is he who gives us the year and the seasons and is the author of all that we see
how will they rejoice in passing from darkness to light
how worthless to them will seem the honours and glories of the den
but now imagine further that they descend into their old habitations in that underground dwelling they will not see as well as their fellows and will not be able to compete with them in the measurement of the shadows on the wall there will be many jokes about the man who went on a visit to the sun and lost his eyes and if they find anybody trying to set free and enlighten one of their number they will put him to death if they can catch him
now the cave or den is the world of sight the fire is the sun the way upwards is the way to knowledge and in the world of knowledge the idea of good is last seen and with difficulty but when seen is inferred to be the author of good and right parent of the lord of light in this world and of truth and understanding in the other
he who attains to the beatific vision is always going upwards he is unwilling to descend into political assemblies and courts of law for his eyes are apt to blink at the images or shadows of images which they behold in them he cannot enter into the ideas of those who have never in their lives understood the relation of the shadow to the substance
but blindness is of two kinds and may be caused either by passing out of darkness into light or out of light into darkness and a man of sense will distinguish between them and will not laugh equally at both of them but the blindness which arises from fulness of light he will deem blessed and pity the other or if he laugh at the puzzled soul looking at the sun he will have more reason to laugh than the inhabitants of the den at those who descend from above
there is a further lesson taught by this parable of ours
some persons fancy that instruction is like giving eyes to the blind but we say that the faculty of sight was always there and that the soul only requires to be turned round towards the light
and this is conversion other virtues are almost like bodily habits and may be acquired in the same manner but intelligence has a diviner life and is indestructible turning either to good or evil according to the direction given
did you never observe how the mind of a clever rogue peers out of his eyes and the more clearly he sees the more evil he does
now if you take such an one and cut away from him those leaden weights of pleasure and desire which bind his soul to earth his intelligence will be turned round and he will behold the truth as clearly as he now discerns his meaner ends
and have we not decided that our rulers must neither be so uneducated as to have no fixed rule of life nor so over educated as to be unwilling to leave their paradise for the business of the world
we must choose out therefore the natures who are most likely to ascend to the light and knowledge of the good but we must not allow them to remain in the region of light they must be forced down again among the captives in the den to partake of their labours and honours
will they not think this a hardship
you should remember that our purpose in framing the state was not that our citizens should do what they like but that they should serve the state for the common good of all
may we not fairly say to our philosopher friend we do you no wrong for in other states philosophy grows wild and a wild plant owes nothing to the gardener but you have been trained by us to be the rulers and kings of our hive and therefore we must insist on your descending into the den
you must each of you take your turn and become able to use your eyes in the dark and with a little practice you will see far better than those who quarrel about the shadows whose knowledge is a dream only whilst yours is a waking reality
it may be that the saint or philosopher who is best fitted may also be the least inclined to rule but necessity is laid upon him and he must no longer live in the heaven of ideas
and this will be the salvation of the state
for those who rule must not be those who are desirous to rule and if you can offer to our citizens a better life than that of rulers generally is there will be a chance that the rich not only in this world s goods but in virtue and wisdom may bear rule
and the only life which is better than the life of political ambition is that of philosophy which is also the best preparation for the government of a state
then now comes the question how shall we create our rulers what way is there from darkness to light
the change is effected by philosophy it is not the turning over of an oyster shell but the conversion of a soul from night to day from becoming to being
and what training will draw the soul upwards
our former education had two branches gymnastic which was occupied with the body and music the sister art which infused a natural harmony into mind and literature but neither of these sciences gave any promise of doing what we want
nothing remains to us but that universal or primary science of which all the arts and sciences are partakers i mean number or calculation
very true
including the art of war
yes certainly
then there is something ludicrous about palamedes in the tragedy coming in and saying that he had invented number and had counted the ranks and set them in order
for if agamemnon could not count his feet he must have been a pretty sort of general indeed
no man should be a soldier who cannot count and indeed he is hardly to be called a man
but i am not speaking of these practical applications of arithmetic for number in my view is rather to be regarded as a conductor to thought and being
i will explain what i mean by the last expression things sensible are of two kinds the one class invite or stimulate the mind while in the other the mind acquiesces
now the stimulating class are the things which suggest contrast and relation
for example suppose that i hold up to the eyes three fingers a fore finger a middle finger a little finger the sight equally recognizes all three fingers but without number cannot further distinguish them
or again suppose two objects to be relatively great and small these ideas of greatness and smallness are supplied not by the sense but by the mind
and the perception of their contrast or relation quickens and sets in motion the mind which is puzzled by the confused intimations of sense and has recourse to number in order to find out whether the things indicated are one or more than one
number replies that they are two and not one and are to be distinguished from one another
again the sight beholds great and small but only in a confused chaos and not until they are distinguished does the question arise of their respective natures we are thus led on to the distinction between the visible and intelligible
that was what i meant when i spoke of stimulants to the intellect i was thinking of the contradictions which arise in perception
the idea of unity for example like that of a finger does not arouse thought unless involving some conception of plurality but when the one is also the opposite of one the contradiction gives rise to reflection an example of this is afforded by any object of sight
all number has also an elevating effect it raises the mind out of the foam and flux of generation to the contemplation of being having lesser military and retail uses also
the retail use is not required by us but as our guardian is to be a soldier as well as a philosopher the military one may be retained
and to our higher purpose no science can be better adapted but it must be pursued in the spirit of a philosopher not of a shopkeeper
it is concerned not with visible objects but with abstract truth for numbers are pure abstractions the true arithmetician indignantly denies that his unit is capable of division
when you divide he insists that you are only multiplying his one is not material or resolvable into fractions but an unvarying and absolute equality and this proves the purely intellectual character of his study
note also the great power which arithmetic has of sharpening the wits no other discipline is equally severe or an equal test of general ability or equally improving to a stupid person
let our second branch of education be geometry
i can easily see replied glaucon that the skill of the general will be doubled by his knowledge of geometry
that is a small matter the use of geometry to which i refer is the assistance given by it in the contemplation of the idea of good and the compelling the mind to look at true being and not at generation only
yet the present mode of pursuing these studies as any one who is the least of a mathematician is aware is mean and ridiculous they are made to look downwards to the arts and not upwards to eternal existence
the geometer is always talking of squaring subtending apposing as if he had in view action whereas knowledge is the real object of the study
it should elevate the soul and create the mind of philosophy it should raise up what has fallen down not to speak of lesser uses in war and military tactics and in the improvement of the faculties
shall we propose as a third branch of our education astronomy
very good replied glaucon the knowledge of the heavens is necessary at once for husbandry navigation military tactics
i like your way of giving useful reasons for everything in order to make friends of the world
and there is a difficulty in proving to mankind that education is not only useful information but a purification of the eye of the soul which is better than the bodily eye for by this alone is truth seen
now will you appeal to mankind in general or to the philosopher
or would you prefer to look to yourself only
every man is his own best friend
then take a step backward for we are out of order and insert the third dimension which is of solids after the second which is of planes and then you may proceed to solids in motion
but solid geometry is not popular and has not the patronage of the state nor is the use of it fully recognized the difficulty is great and the votaries of the study are conceited and impatient
still the charm of the pursuit wins upon men and if government would lend a little assistance there might be great progress made
very true replied glaucon but do i understand you now to begin with plane geometry and to place next geometry of solids and thirdly astronomy or the motion of solids
yes i said my hastiness has only hindered us
very good and now let us proceed to astronomy about which i am willing to speak in your lofty strain
no one can fail to see that the contemplation of the heavens draws the soul upwards
i am an exception then astronomy as studied at present appears to me to draw the soul not upwards but downwards
star gazing is just looking up at the ceiling no better a man may lie on his back on land or on water he may look up or look down but there is no science in that
the vision of knowledge of which i speak is seen not with the eyes but with the mind
all the magnificence of the heavens is but the embroidery of a copy which falls far short of the divine original and teaches nothing about the absolute harmonies or motions of things
their beauty is like the beauty of figures drawn by the hand of daedalus or any other great artist which may be used for illustration but no mathematician would seek to obtain from them true conceptions of equality or numerical relations
how ridiculous then to look for these in the map of the heavens in which the imperfection of matter comes in everywhere as a disturbing element marring the symmetry of day and night of months and years of the sun and stars in their courses
only by problems can we place astronomy on a truly scientific basis
let the heavens alone and exert the intellect
still mathematics admit of other applications as the pythagoreans say and we agree
there is a sister science of harmonical motion adapted to the ear as astronomy is to the eye and there may be other applications also
let us inquire of the pythagoreans about them not forgetting that we have an aim higher than theirs which is the relation of these sciences to the idea of good
the error which pervades astronomy also pervades harmonics
the musicians put their ears in the place of their minds
yes replied glaucon i like to see them laying their ears alongside of their neighbours faces some saying that s a new note others declaring that the two notes are the same
yes i said but you mean the empirics who are always twisting and torturing the strings of the lyre and quarrelling about the tempers of the strings i am referring rather to the pythagorean harmonists who are almost equally in error
for they investigate only the numbers of the consonances which are heard and ascend no higher of the true numerical harmony which is unheard and is only to be found in problems they have not even a conception
that last he said must be a marvellous thing
a thing i replied which is only useful if pursued with a view to the good
all these sciences are the prelude of the strain and are profitable if they are regarded in their natural relations to one another
i dare say socrates said glaucon but such a study will be an endless business
what study do you mean of the prelude or what
for all these things are only the prelude and you surely do not suppose that a mere mathematician is also a dialectician
certainly not
i have hardly ever known a mathematician who could reason
and yet glaucon is not true reasoning that hymn of dialectic which is the music of the intellectual world and which was by us compared to the effort of sight when from beholding the shadows on the wall we arrived at last at the images which gave the shadows
even so the dialectical faculty withdrawing from sense arrives by the pure intellect at the contemplation of the idea of good and never rests but at the very end of the intellectual world
and the royal road out of the cave into the light and the blinking of the eyes at the sun and turning to contemplate the shadows of reality not the shadows of an image only this progress and gradual acquisition of a new faculty of sight by the help of the mathematical sciences is the elevation of the soul to the contemplation of the highest ideal of being
so far i agree with you
but now leaving the prelude let us proceed to the hymn
what then is the nature of dialectic and what are the paths which lead thither
dear glaucon you cannot follow me here
there can be no revelation of the absolute truth to one who has not been disciplined in the previous sciences
but that there is a science of absolute truth which is attained in some way very different from those now practised i am confident
for all other arts or sciences are relative to human needs and opinions and the mathematical sciences are but a dream or hypothesis of true being and never analyse their own principles
dialectic alone rises to the principle which is above hypotheses converting and gently leading the eye of the soul out of the barbarous slough of ignorance into the light of the upper world with the help of the sciences which we have been describing sciences as they are often termed although they require some other name implying greater clearness than opinion and less clearness than science and this in our previous sketch was understanding
and so we get four names two for intellect and two for opinion reason or mind understanding faith perception of shadows which make a proportion being becoming intellect opinion and science belief understanding perception of shadows
dialectic may be further described as that science which defines and explains the essence or being of each nature which distinguishes and abstracts the good and is ready to do battle against all opponents in the cause of good
to him who is not a dialectician life is but a sleepy dream and many a man is in his grave before his is well waked up
and would you have the future rulers of your ideal state intelligent beings or stupid as posts
certainly not the latter
then you must train them in dialectic which will teach them to ask and answer questions and is the coping stone of the sciences
i dare say that you have not forgotten how our rulers were chosen and the process of selection may be carried a step further as before they must be constant and valiant good looking and of noble manners but now they must also have natural ability which education will improve that is to say they must be quick at learning capable of mental toil retentive solid diligent natures who combine intellectual with moral virtues not lame and one sided diligent in bodily exercise and indolent in mind or conversely not a maimed soul which hates falsehood and yet unintentionally is always wallowing in the mire of ignorance not a bastard or feeble person but sound in wind and limb and in perfect condition for the great gymnastic trial of the mind
justice herself can find no fault with natures such as these and they will be the saviours of our state disciples of another sort would only make philosophy more ridiculous than she is at present
forgive my enthusiasm i am becoming excited but when i see her trampled underfoot i am angry at the authors of her disgrace
i did not notice that you were more excited than you ought to have been
but i felt that i was
now do not let us forget another point in the selection of our disciples that they must be young and not old
for solon is mistaken in saying that an old man can be always learning youth is the time of study and here we must remember that the mind is free and dainty and unlike the body must not be made to work against the grain
learning should be at first a sort of play in which the natural bent is detected
as in training them for war the young dogs should at first only taste blood but when the necessary gymnastics are over which during two or three years divide life between sleep and bodily exercise then the education of the soul will become a more serious matter
at twenty years of age a selection must be made of the more promising disciples with whom a new epoch of education will begin
the sciences which they have hitherto learned in fragments will now be brought into relation with each other and with true being for the power of combining them is the test of speculative and dialectical ability
and afterwards at thirty a further selection shall be made of those who are able to withdraw from the world of sense into the abstraction of ideas
but at this point judging from present experience there is a danger that dialectic may be the source of many evils
the danger may be illustrated by a parallel case imagine a person who has been brought up in wealth and luxury amid a crowd of flatterers and who is suddenly informed that he is a supposititious son
he has hitherto honoured his reputed parents and disregarded the flatterers and now he does the reverse
this is just what happens with a man s principles
there are certain doctrines which he learnt at home and which exercised a parental authority over him
presently he finds that imputations are cast upon them a troublesome querist comes and asks what is the just and good
or proves that virtue is vice and vice virtue and his mind becomes unsettled and he ceases to love honour and obey them as he has hitherto done
he is seduced into the life of pleasure and becomes a lawless person and a rogue
the case of such speculators is very pitiable and in order that our thirty years old pupils may not require this pity let us take every possible care that young persons do not study philosophy too early
for a young man is a sort of puppy who only plays with an argument and is reasoned into and out of his opinions every day he soon begins to believe nothing and brings himself and philosophy into discredit
a man of thirty does not run on in this way he will argue and not merely contradict and adds new honour to philosophy by the sobriety of his conduct
what time shall we allow for this second gymnastic training of the soul
say twice the time required for the gymnastics of the body six or perhaps five years to commence at thirty and then for fifteen years let the student go down into the den and command armies and gain experience of life
at fifty let him return to the end of all things and have his eyes uplifted to the idea of good and order his life after that pattern if necessary taking his turn at the helm of state and training up others to be his successors
when his time comes he shall depart in peace to the islands of the blest
he shall be honoured with sacrifices and receive such worship as the pythian oracle approves
you are a statuary socrates and have made a perfect image of our governors
yes and of our governesses for the women will share in all things with the men
and you will admit that our state is not a mere aspiration but may really come into being when there shall arise philosopher kings one or more who will despise earthly vanities and will be the servants of justice only
and how will they begin their work
their first act will be to send away into the country all those who are more than ten years of age and to proceed with those who are left
at the commencement of the sixth book plato anticipated his explanation of the relation of the philosopher to the world in an allegory in this as in other passages following the order which he prescribes in education and proceeding from the concrete to the abstract
at the commencement of book vii under the figure of a cave having an opening towards a fire and a way upwards to the true light he returns to view the divisions of knowledge exhibiting familiarly as in a picture the result which had been hardly won by a great effort of thought in the previous discussion at the same time casting a glance onward at the dialectical process which is represented by the way leading from darkness to light
the shadows the images the reflection of the sun and stars in the water the stars and sun themselves severally correspond the first to the realm of fancy and poetry the second to the world of sense the third to the abstractions or universals of sense of which the mathematical sciences furnish the type the fourth and last to the same abstractions when seen in the unity of the idea from which they derive a new meaning and power
the true dialectical process begins with the contemplation of the real stars and not mere reflections of them and ends with the recognition of the sun or idea of good as the parent not only of light but of warmth and growth
to the divisions of knowledge the stages of education partly answer first there is the early education of childhood and youth in the fancies of the poets and in the laws and customs of the state then there is the training of the body to be a warrior athlete and a good servant of the mind and thirdly after an interval follows the education of later life which begins with mathematics and proceeds to philosophy in general
there seem to be two great aims in the philosophy of plato first to realize abstractions secondly to connect them
according to him the true education is that which draws men from becoming to being and to a comprehensive survey of all being
he desires to develop in the human mind the faculty of seeing the universal in all things until at last the particulars of sense drop away and the universal alone remains
he then seeks to combine the universals which he has disengaged from sense not perceiving that the correlation of them has no other basis but the common use of language
he never understands that abstractions as hegel says are mere abstractions of use when employed in the arrangement of facts but adding nothing to the sum of knowledge when pursued apart from them or with reference to an imaginary idea of good
still the exercise of the faculty of abstraction apart from facts has enlarged the mind and played a great part in the education of the human race
plato appreciated the value of this faculty and saw that it might be quickened by the study of number and relation
all things in which there is opposition or proportion are suggestive of reflection
the mere impression of sense evokes no power of thought or of mind but when sensible objects ask to be compared and distinguished then philosophy begins
the science of arithmetic first suggests such distinctions
the follow in order the other sciences of plain and solid geometry and of solids in motion one branch of which is astronomy or the harmony of the spheres to this is appended the sister science of the harmony of sounds
plato seems also to hint at the possibility of other applications of arithmetical or mathematical proportions such as we employ in chemistry and natural philosophy such as the pythagoreans and even aristotle make use of in ethics and politics e.g
his distinction between arithmetical and geometrical proportion in the ethics or between numerical and proportional equality in the politics
the modern mathematician will readily sympathise with plato s delight in the properties of pure mathematics
he will not be disinclined to say with him let alone the heavens and study the beauties of number and figure in themselves
he too will be apt to depreciate their application to the arts
he will observe that plato has a conception of geometry in which figures are to be dispensed with thus in a distant and shadowy way seeming to anticipate the possibility of working geometrical problems by a more general mode of analysis
he will remark with interest on the backward state of solid geometry which alas
was not encouraged by the aid of the state in the age of plato and he will recognize the grasp of plato s mind in his ability to conceive of one science of solids in motion including the earth as well as the heavens not forgetting to notice the intimation to which allusion has been already made that besides astronomy and harmonics the science of solids in motion may have other applications
still more will he be struck with the comprehensiveness of view which led plato at a time when these sciences hardly existed to say that they must be studied in relation to one another and to the idea of good or common principle of truth and being
but he will also see that in that stage of physical and mathematical knowledge plato has fallen into the error of supposing that he can construct the heavens a priori by mathematical problems and determine the principles of harmony irrespective of the adaptation of sounds to the human ear
the illusion was a natural one in that age and country
the simplicity and certainty of astronomy and harmonics seemed to contrast with the variation and complexity of the world of sense hence the circumstance that there was some elementary basis of fact some measurement of distance or time or vibrations on which they must ultimately rest was overlooked by him
the modern predecessors of newton fell into errors equally great and plato can hardly be said to have been very far wrong or may even claim a sort of prophetic insight into the subject when we consider that the greater part of astronomy at the present day consists of abstract dynamics by the help of which most astronomical discoveries have been made
the metaphysical philosopher from his point of view recognizes mathematics as an instrument of education which strengthens the power of attention developes the sense of order and the faculty of construction and enables the mind to grasp under simple formulae the quantitative differences of physical phenomena
but while acknowledging their value in education he sees also that they have no connexion with our higher moral and intellectual ideas
in the attempt which plato makes to connect them we easily trace the influences of ancient pythagorean notions
there is no reason to suppose that he is speaking of the ideal numbers but he is describing numbers which are pure abstractions to which he assigns a real and separate existence which as the teachers of the art would have affirmed repel all attempts at subdivision and in which unity and every other number are conceived of as absolute
the truth and certainty of numbers when thus disengaged from phenomena gave them a kind of sacredness in the eyes of an ancient philosopher
nor is it easy to say how far ideas of order and fixedness may have had a moral and elevating influence on the minds of men who in the words of the timaeus might learn to regulate their erring lives according to them
it is worthy of remark that the old pythagorean ethical symbols still exist as figures of speech among ourselves
and those who in modern times see the world pervaded by universal law may also see an anticipation of this last word of modern philosophy in the platonic idea of good which is the source and measure of all things and yet only an abstraction 
two passages seem to require more particular explanations
first that which relates to the analysis of vision
the difficulty in this passage may be explained like many others from differences in the modes of conception prevailing among ancient and modern thinkers
to us the perceptions of sense are inseparable from the act of the mind which accompanies them
the consciousness of form colour distance is indistinguishable from the simple sensation which is the medium of them
whereas to plato sense is the heraclitean flux of sense not the vision of objects in the order in which they actually present themselves to the experienced sight but as they may be imagined to appear confused and blurred to the half awakened eye of the infant
the first action of the mind is aroused by the attempt to set in order this chaos and the reason is required to frame distinct conceptions under which the confused impressions of sense may be arranged
hence arises the question what is great what is small
and thus begins the distinction of the visible and the intelligible
the second difficulty relates to plato s conception of harmonics
three classes of harmonists are distinguished by him first the pythagoreans whom he proposes to consult as in the previous discussion on music he was to consult damon they are acknowledged to be masters in the art but are altogether deficient in the knowledge of its higher import and relation to the good secondly the mere empirics whom glaucon appears to confuse with them and whom both he and socrates ludicrously describe as experimenting by mere auscultation on the intervals of sounds
both of these fall short in different degrees of the platonic idea of harmony which must be studied in a purely abstract way first by the method of problems and secondly as a part of universal knowledge in relation to the idea of good
the allegory has a political as well as a philosophical meaning
the den or cave represents the narrow sphere of politics or law and the light of the eternal ideas is supposed to exercise a disturbing influence on the minds of those who return to this lower world
in other words their principles are too wide for practical application they are looking far away into the past and future when their business is with the present
the ideal is not easily reduced to the conditions of actual life and may often be at variance with them
and at first those who return are unable to compete with the inhabitants of the den in the measurement of the shadows and are derided and persecuted by them but after a while they see the things below in far truer proportions than those who have never ascended into the upper world
the difference between the politician turned into a philosopher and the philosopher turned into a politician is symbolized by the two kinds of disordered eyesight the one which is experienced by the captive who is transferred from darkness to day the other of the heavenly messenger who voluntarily for the good of his fellow men descends into the den
in what way the brighter light is to dawn on the inhabitants of the lower world or how the idea of good is to become the guiding principle of politics is left unexplained by plato
like the nature and divisions of dialectic of which glaucon impatiently demands to be informed perhaps he would have said that the explanation could not be given except to a disciple of the previous sciences
many illustrations of this part of the republic may be found in modern politics and in daily life
for among ourselves too there have been two sorts of politicians or statesmen whose eyesight has become disordered in two different ways
first there have been great men who in the language of burke have been too much given to general maxims who like j.s
mill or burke himself have been theorists or philosophers before they were politicians or who having been students of history have allowed some great historical parallel such as the english revolution of 1688 or possibly athenian democracy or roman imperialism to be the medium through which they viewed contemporary events
or perhaps the long projecting shadow of some existing institution may have darkened their vision
the church of the future the commonwealth of the future the society of the future have so absorbed their minds that they are unable to see in their true proportions the politics of to day
they have been intoxicated with great ideas such as liberty or equality or the greatest happiness of the greatest number or the brotherhood of humanity and they no longer care to consider how these ideas must be limited in practice or harmonized with the conditions of human life
they are full of light but the light to them has become only a sort of luminous mist or blindness
almost every one has known some enthusiastic half educated person who sees everything at false distances and in erroneous proportions
with this disorder of eyesight may be contrasted another of those who see not far into the distance but what is near only who have been engaged all their lives in a trade or a profession who are limited to a set or sect of their own
men of this kind have no universal except their own interests or the interests of their class no principle but the opinion of persons like themselves no knowledge of affairs beyond what they pick up in the streets or at their club
suppose them to be sent into a larger world to undertake some higher calling from being tradesmen to turn generals or politicians from being schoolmasters to become philosophers or imagine them on a sudden to receive an inward light which reveals to them for the first time in their lives a higher idea of god and the existence of a spiritual world by this sudden conversion or change is not their daily life likely to be upset and on the other hand will not many of their old prejudices and narrownesses still adhere to them long after they have begun to take a more comprehensive view of human things
from familiar examples like these we may learn what plato meant by the eyesight which is liable to two kinds of disorders
nor have we any difficulty in drawing a parallel between the young athenian in the fifth century before christ who became unsettled by new ideas and the student of a modern university who has been the subject of a similar aufklarung
we too observe that when young men begin to criticise customary beliefs or to analyse the constitution of human nature they are apt to lose hold of solid principle 
they are like trees which have been frequently transplanted
the earth about them is loose and they have no roots reaching far into the soil
they light upon every flower following their own wayward wills or because the wind blows them
they catch opinions as diseases are caught when they are in the air
borne hither and thither they speedily fall into beliefs the opposite of those in which they were brought up
they hardly retain the distinction of right and wrong they seem to think one thing as good as another
they suppose themselves to be searching after truth when they are playing the game of follow my leader
they fall in love at first sight with paradoxes respecting morality some fancy about art some novelty or eccentricity in religion and like lovers they are so absorbed for a time in their new notion that they can think of nothing else
the resolution of some philosophical or theological question seems to them more interesting and important than any substantial knowledge of literature or science or even than a good life
like the youth in the philebus they are ready to discourse to any one about a new philosophy
they are generally the disciples of some eminent professor or sophist whom they rather imitate than understand
they may be counted happy if in later years they retain some of the simple truths which they acquired in early education and which they may perhaps find to be worth all the rest
such is the picture which plato draws and which we only reproduce partly in his own words of the dangers which beset youth in times of transition when old opinions are fading away and the new are not yet firmly established
their condition is ingeniously compared by him to that of a supposititious son who has made the discovery that his reputed parents are not his real ones and in consequence they have lost their authority over him
the distinction between the mathematician and the dialectician is also noticeable
plato is very well aware that the faculty of the mathematician is quite distinct from the higher philosophical sense which recognizes and combines first principles
the contempt which he expresses for distinctions of words the danger of involuntary falsehood the apology which socrates makes for his earnestness of speech are highly characteristic of the platonic style and mode of thought
the quaint notion that if palamedes was the inventor of number agamemnon could not have counted his feet the art by which we are made to believe that this state of ours is not a dream only the gravity with which the first step is taken in the actual creation of the state namely the sending out of the city all who had arrived at ten years of age in order to expedite the business of education by a generation are also truly platonic
book viii
and so we have arrived at the conclusion that in the perfect state wives and children are to be in common and the education and pursuits of men and women both in war and peace are to be common and kings are to be philosophers and warriors and the soldiers of the state are to live together having all things in common and they are to be warrior athletes receiving no pay but only their food from the other citizens
now let us return to the point at which we digressed
that is easily done he replied you were speaking of the state which you had constructed and of the individual who answered to this both of whom you affirmed to be good and you said that of inferior states there were four forms and four individuals corresponding to them which although deficient in various degrees were all of them worth inspecting with a view to determining the relative happiness or misery of the best or worst man
then polemarchus and adeimantus interrupted you and this led to another argument and so here we are
suppose that we put ourselves again in the same position and do you repeat your question
i should like to know of what constitutions you were speaking
besides the perfect state there are only four of any note in hellas first the famous lacedaemonian or cretan commonwealth secondly oligarchy a state full of evils thirdly democracy which follows next in order fourthly tyranny which is the disease or death of all government
now states are not made of oak and rock but of flesh and blood and therefore as there are five states there must be five human natures in individuals which correspond to them
and first there is the ambitious nature which answers to the lacedaemonian state secondly the oligarchical nature thirdly the democratical and fourthly the tyrannical
this last will have to be compared with the perfectly just which is the fifth that we may know which is the happier and then we shall be able to determine whether the argument of thrasymachus or our own is the more convincing
and as before we began with the state and went on to the individual so now beginning with timocracy let us go on to the timocratical man and then proceed to the other forms of government and the individuals who answer to them
but how did timocracy arise out of the perfect state
plainly like all changes of government from division in the rulers
but whence came division
sing heavenly muses as homer says let them condescend to answer us as if we were children to whom they put on a solemn face in jest
and what will they say
they will say that human things are fated to decay and even the perfect state will not escape from this law of destiny when the wheel comes full circle in a period short or long
plants or animals have times of fertility and sterility which the intelligence of rulers because alloyed by sense will not enable them to ascertain and children will be born out of season
for whereas divine creations are in a perfect cycle or number the human creation is in a number which declines from perfection and has four terms and three intervals of numbers increasing waning assimilating dissimilating and yet perfectly commensurate with each other
the base of the number with a fourth added multiplied by five and cubed gives two harmonies the first a square number which is a hundred times the base the second an oblong being a hundred squares of the rational diameter of a figure the side of which is five subtracting one from each square or two perfect squares from all and adding a hundred cubes of three
this entire number is geometrical and contains the rule or law of generation
when this law is neglected marriages will be unpropitious the inferior offspring who are then born will in time become the rulers the state will decline and education fall into decay gymnastic will be preferred to music and the gold and silver and brass and iron will form a chaotic mass thus division will arise
such is the muses answer to our question
and a true answer of course but what more have they to say
they say that the two races the iron and brass and the silver and gold will draw the state different ways the one will take to trade and moneymaking and the others having the true riches and not caring for money will resist them the contest will end in a compromise they will agree to have private property and will enslave their fellow citizens who were once their friends and nurturers
but they will retain their warlike character and will be chiefly occupied in fighting and exercising rule
thus arises timocracy which is intermediate between aristocracy and oligarchy
the new form of government resembles the ideal in obedience to rulers and contempt for trade and having common meals and in devotion to warlike and gymnastic exercises
but corruption has crept into philosophy and simplicity of character which was once her note is now looked for only in the military class
arts of war begin to prevail over arts of peace the ruler is no longer a philosopher as in oligarchies there springs up among them an extravagant love of gain get another man s and save your own is their principle and they have dark places in which they hoard their gold and silver for the use of their women and others they take their pleasures by stealth like boys who are running away from their father the law and their education is not inspired by the muse but imposed by the strong arm of power
the leading characteristic of this state is party spirit and ambition
and what manner of man answers to such a state
in love of contention replied adeimantus he will be like our friend glaucon
in that respect perhaps but not in others
he is self asserting and ill educated yet fond of literature although not himself a speaker fierce with slaves but obedient to rulers a lover of power and honour which he hopes to gain by deeds of arms fond too of gymnastics and of hunting
as he advances in years he grows avaricious for he has lost philosophy which is the only saviour and guardian of men
his origin is as follows his father is a good man dwelling in an ill ordered state who has retired from politics in order that he may lead a quiet life
his mother is angry at her loss of precedence among other women she is disgusted at her husband s selfishness and she expatiates to her son on the unmanliness and indolence of his father
the old family servant takes up the tale and says to the youth when you grow up you must be more of a man than your father
all the world are agreed that he who minds his own business is an idiot while a busybody is highly honoured and esteemed
the young man compares this spirit with his father s words and ways and as he is naturally well disposed although he has suffered from evil influences he rests at a middle point and becomes ambitious and a lover of honour
and now let us set another city over against another man
the next form of government is oligarchy in which the rule is of the rich only nor is it difficult to see how such a state arises
the decline begins with the possession of gold and silver illegal modes of expenditure are invented one draws another on and the multitude are infected riches outweigh virtue lovers of money take the place of lovers of honour misers of politicians and in time political privileges are confined by law to the rich who do not shrink from violence in order to effect their purposes
thus much of the origin let us next consider the evils of oligarchy
would a man who wanted to be safe on a voyage take a bad pilot because he was rich or refuse a good one because he was poor
and does not the analogy apply still more to the state
and there are yet greater evils two nations are struggling together in one the rich and the poor and the rich dare not put arms into the hands of the poor and are unwilling to pay for defenders out of their own money
and have we not already condemned that state in which the same persons are warriors as well as shopkeepers
the greatest evil of all is that a man may sell his property and have no place in the state while there is one class which has enormous wealth the other is entirely destitute
but observe that these destitutes had not really any more of the governing nature in them when they were rich than now that they are poor they were miserable spendthrifts always
they are the drones of the hive only whereas the actual drone is unprovided by nature with a sting the two legged things whom we call drones are some of them without stings and some of them have dreadful stings in other words there are paupers and there are rogues
these are never far apart and in oligarchical cities where nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler you will find abundance of both
and this evil state of society originates in bad education and bad government
like state like man the change in the latter begins with the representative of timocracy he walks at first in the ways of his father who may have been a statesman or general perhaps and presently he sees him fallen from his high estate the victim of informers dying in prison or exile or by the hand of the executioner
the lesson which he thus receives makes him cautious he leaves politics represses his pride and saves pence
avarice is enthroned as his bosom s lord and assumes the style of the great king the rational and spirited elements sit humbly on the ground at either side the one immersed in calculation the other absorbed in the admiration of wealth
the love of honour turns to love of money the conversion is instantaneous
the man is mean saving toiling the slave of one passion which is the master of the rest is he not the very image of the state
he has had no education or he would never have allowed the blind god of riches to lead the dance within him
and being uneducated he will have many slavish desires some beggarly some knavish breeding in his soul
if he is the trustee of an orphan and has the power to defraud he will soon prove that he is not without the will and that his passions are only restrained by fear and not by reason
hence he leads a divided existence in which the better desires mostly prevail
but when he is contending for prizes and other distinctions he is afraid to incur a loss which is to be repaid only by barren honour in time of war he fights with a small part of his resources and usually keeps his money and loses the victory
next comes democracy and the democratic man out of oligarchy and the oligarchical man
insatiable avarice is the ruling passion of an oligarchy and they encourage expensive habits in order that they may gain by the ruin of extravagant youth
thus men of family often lose their property or rights of citizenship but they remain in the city full of hatred against the new owners of their estates and ripe for revolution
the usurer with stooping walk pretends not to see them he passes by and leaves his sting that is his money in some other victim and many a man has to pay the parent or principal sum multiplied into a family of children and is reduced into a state of dronage by him
the only way of diminishing the evil is either to limit a man in his use of his property or to insist that he shall lend at his own risk
but the ruling class do not want remedies they care only for money and are as careless of virtue as the poorest of the citizens
now there are occasions on which the governors and the governed meet together at festivals on a journey voyaging or fighting
the sturdy pauper finds that in the hour of danger he is not despised he sees the rich man puffing and panting and draws the conclusion which he privately imparts to his companions that our people are not good for much and as a sickly frame is made ill by a mere touch from without or sometimes without external impulse is ready to fall to pieces of itself so from the least cause or with none at all the city falls ill and fights a battle for life or death
and democracy comes into power when the poor are the victors killing some and exiling some and giving equal shares in the government to all the rest
the manner of life in such a state is that of democrats there is freedom and plainness of speech and every man does what is right in his own eyes and has his own way of life
hence arise the most various developments of character the state is like a piece of embroidery of which the colours and figures are the manners of men and there are many who like women and children prefer this variety to real beauty and excellence
the state is not one but many like a bazaar at which you can buy anything
the great charm is that you may do as you like you may govern if you like let it alone if you like go to war and make peace if you feel disposed and all quite irrespective of anybody else
when you condemn men to death they remain alive all the same a gentleman is desired to go into exile and he stalks about the streets like a hero and nobody sees him or cares for him
observe too how grandly democracy sets her foot upon all our fine theories of education how little she cares for the training of her statesmen
the only qualification which she demands is the profession of patriotism
such is democracy a pleasing lawless various sort of government distributing equality to equals and unequals alike
let us now inspect the individual democrat and first as in the case of the state we will trace his antecedents
he is the son of a miserly oligarch and has been taught by him to restrain the love of unnecessary pleasures
perhaps i ought to explain this latter term necessary pleasures are those which are good and which we cannot do without unnecessary pleasures are those which do no good and of which the desire might be eradicated by early training
for example the pleasures of eating and drinking are necessary and healthy up to a certain point beyond that point they are alike hurtful to body and mind and the excess may be avoided
when in excess they may be rightly called expensive pleasures in opposition to the useful ones
and the drone as we called him is the slave of these unnecessary pleasures and desires whereas the miserly oligarch is subject only to the necessary
the oligarch changes into the democrat in the following manner the youth who has had a miserly bringing up gets a taste of the drone s honey he meets with wild companions who introduce him to every new pleasure
as in the state so in the individual there are allies on both sides temptations from without and passions from within there is reason also and external influences of parents and friends in alliance with the oligarchical principle and the two factions are in violent conflict with one another
sometimes the party of order prevails but then again new desires and new disorders arise and the whole mob of passions gets possession of the acropolis that is to say the soul which they find void and unguarded by true words and works
falsehoods and illusions ascend to take their place the prodigal goes back into the country of the lotophagi or drones and openly dwells there
and if any offer of alliance or parley of individual elders comes from home the false spirits shut the gates of the castle and permit no one to enter there is a battle and they gain the victory and straightway making alliance with the desires they banish modesty which they call folly and send temperance over the border
when the house has been swept and garnished they dress up the exiled vices and crowning them with garlands bring them back under new names
insolence they call good breeding anarchy freedom waste magnificence impudence courage
such is the process by which the youth passes from the necessary pleasures to the unnecessary
after a while he divides his time impartially between them and perhaps when he gets older and the violence of passion has abated he restores some of the exiles and lives in a sort of equilibrium indulging first one pleasure and then another and if reason comes and tells him that some pleasures are good and honourable and others bad and vile he shakes his head and says that he can make no distinction between them
thus he lives in the fancy of the hour sometimes he takes to drink and then he turns abstainer he practises in the gymnasium or he does nothing at all then again he would be a philosopher or a politician or again he would be a warrior or a man of business he is every thing by starts and nothing long
there remains still the finest and fairest of all men and all states tyranny and the tyrant
tyranny springs from democracy much as democracy springs from oligarchy
both arise from excess the one from excess of wealth the other from excess of freedom
the great natural good of life says the democrat is freedom
and this exclusive love of freedom and regardlessness of everything else is the cause of the change from democracy to tyranny
the state demands the strong wine of freedom and unless her rulers give her a plentiful draught punishes and insults them equality and fraternity of governors and governed is the approved principle
anarchy is the law not of the state only but of private houses and extends even to the animals
father and son citizen and foreigner teacher and pupil old and young are all on a level fathers and teachers fear their sons and pupils and the wisdom of the young man is a match for the elder and the old imitate the jaunty manners of the young because they are afraid of being thought morose
slaves are on a level with their masters and mistresses and there is no difference between men and women
nay the very animals in a democratic state have a freedom which is unknown in other places
the she dogs are as good as their she mistresses and horses and asses march along with dignity and run their noses against anybody who comes in their way
that has often been my experience
at last the citizens become so sensitive that they cannot endure the yoke of laws written or unwritten they would have no man call himself their master
such is the glorious beginning of things out of which tyranny springs
glorious indeed but what is to follow
the ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy for there is a law of contraries the excess of freedom passes into the excess of slavery and the greater the freedom the greater the slavery
you will remember that in the oligarchy were found two classes rogues and paupers whom we compared to drones with and without stings
these two classes are to the state what phlegm and bile are to the human body and the state physician or legislator must get rid of them just as the bee master keeps the drones out of the hive
now in a democracy too there are drones but they are more numerous and more dangerous than in the oligarchy there they are inert and unpractised here they are full of life and animation and the keener sort speak and act while the others buzz about the bema and prevent their opponents from being heard
and there is another class in democratic states of respectable thriving individuals who can be squeezed when the drones have need of their possessions there is moreover a third class who are the labourers and the artisans and they make up the mass of the people
when the people meet they are omnipotent but they cannot be brought together unless they are attracted by a little honey and the rich are made to supply the honey of which the demagogues keep the greater part themselves giving a taste only to the mob
their victims attempt to resist they are driven mad by the stings of the drones and so become downright oligarchs in self defence
then follow informations and convictions for treason
the people have some protector whom they nurse into greatness and from this root the tree of tyranny springs
the nature of the change is indicated in the old fable of the temple of zeus lycaeus which tells how he who tastes human flesh mixed up with the flesh of other victims will turn into a wolf
even so the protector who tastes human blood and slays some and exiles others with or without law who hints at abolition of debts and division of lands must either perish or become a wolf that is a tyrant
perhaps he is driven out but he soon comes back from exile and then if his enemies cannot get rid of him by lawful means they plot his assassination
thereupon the friend of the people makes his well known request to them for a body guard which they readily grant thinking only of his danger and not of their own
now let the rich man make to himself wings for he will never run away again if he does not do so then
and the great protector having crushed all his rivals stands proudly erect in the chariot of state a full blown tyrant let us enquire into the nature of his happiness
in the early days of his tyranny he smiles and beams upon everybody he is not a dominus no not he he has only come to put an end to debt and the monopoly of land
having got rid of foreign enemies he makes himself necessary to the state by always going to war
he is thus enabled to depress the poor by heavy taxes and so keep them at work and he can get rid of bolder spirits by handing them over to the enemy
then comes unpopularity some of his old associates have the courage to oppose him
the consequence is that he has to make a purgation of the state but unlike the physician who purges away the bad he must get rid of the high spirited the wise and the wealthy for he has no choice between death and a life of shame and dishonour
and the more hated he is the more he will require trusty guards but how will he obtain them
they will come flocking like birds for pay
will he not rather obtain them on the spot
he will take the slaves from their owners and make them his body guard these are his trusted friends who admire and look up to him
are not the tragic poets wise who magnify and exalt the tyrant and say that he is wise by association with the wise
and are not their praises of tyranny alone a sufficient reason why we should exclude them from our state
they may go to other cities and gather the mob about them with fine words and change commonwealths into tyrannies and democracies receiving honours and rewards for their services but the higher they and their friends ascend constitution hill the more their honour will fail and become too asthmatic to mount
to return to the tyrant how will he support that rare army of his
first by robbing the temples of their treasures which will enable him to lighten the taxes then he will take all his father s property and spend it on his companions male or female
now his father is the demus and if the demus gets angry and says that a great hulking son ought not to be a burden on his parents and bids him and his riotous crew begone then will the parent know what a monster he has been nurturing and that the son whom he would fain expel is too strong for him
you do not mean to say that he will beat his father
yes he will after having taken away his arms
then he is a parricide and a cruel unnatural son
and the people have jumped from the fear of slavery into slavery out of the smoke into the fire
thus liberty when out of all order and reason passes into the worst form of servitude
in the previous books plato has described the ideal state now he returns to the perverted or declining forms on which he had lightly touched at the end of book iv
these he describes in a succession of parallels between the individuals and the states tracing the origin of either in the state or individual which has preceded them
he begins by asking the point at which he digressed and is thus led shortly to recapitulate the substance of the three former books which also contain a parallel of the philosopher and the state
of the first decline he gives no intelligible account he would not have liked to admit the most probable causes of the fall of his ideal state which to us would appear to be the impracticability of communism or the natural antagonism of the ruling and subject classes
he throws a veil of mystery over the origin of the decline which he attributes to ignorance of the law of population
of this law the famous geometrical figure or number is the expression
like the ancients in general he had no idea of the gradual perfectibility of man or of the education of the human race
his ideal was not to be attained in the course of ages but was to spring in full armour from the head of the legislator
when good laws had been given he thought only of the manner in which they were likely to be corrupted or of how they might be filled up in detail or restored in accordance with their original spirit
he appears not to have reflected upon the full meaning of his own words in the brief space of human life nothing great can be accomplished or again as he afterwards says in the laws infinite time is the maker of cities
the order of constitutions which is adopted by him represents an order of thought rather than a succession of time and may be considered as the first attempt to frame a philosophy of history
the first of these declining states is timocracy or the government of soldiers and lovers of honour which answers to the spartan state this is a government of force in which education is not inspired by the muses but imposed by the law and in which all the finer elements of organization have disappeared
the philosopher himself has lost the love of truth and the soldier who is of a simpler and honester nature rules in his stead
the individual who answers to timocracy has some noticeable qualities
he is described as ill educated but like the spartan a lover of literature and although he is a harsh master to his servants he has no natural superiority over them
his character is based upon a reaction against the circumstances of his father who in a troubled city has retired from politics and his mother who is dissatisfied at her own position is always urging him towards the life of political ambition
such a character may have had this origin and indeed livy attributes the licinian laws to a feminine jealousy of a similar kind
but there is obviously no connection between the manner in which the timocratic state springs out of the ideal and the mere accident by which the timocratic man is the son of a retired statesman
the two next stages in the decline of constitutions have even less historical foundation
for there is no trace in greek history of a polity like the spartan or cretan passing into an oligarchy of wealth or of the oligarchy of wealth passing into a democracy
the order of history appears to be different first in the homeric times there is the royal or patriarchal form of government which a century or two later was succeeded by an oligarchy of birth rather than of wealth and in which wealth was only the accident of the hereditary possession of land and power
sometimes this oligarchical government gave way to a government based upon a qualification of property which according to aristotle s mode of using words would have been called a timocracy and this in some cities as at athens became the conducting medium to democracy
but such was not the necessary order of succession in states nor indeed can any order be discerned in the endless fluctuation of greek history except perhaps in the almost uniform tendency from monarchy to aristocracy in the earliest times
at first sight there appears to be a similar inversion in the last step of the platonic succession for tyranny instead of being the natural end of democracy in early greek history appears rather as a stage leading to democracy the reign of peisistratus and his sons is an episode which comes between the legislation of solon and the constitution of cleisthenes and some secret cause common to them all seems to have led the greater part of hellas at her first appearance in the dawn of history e.g
athens argos corinth sicyon and nearly every state with the exception of sparta through a similar stage of tyranny which ended either in oligarchy or democracy
but then we must remember that plato is describing rather the contemporary governments of the sicilian states which alternated between democracy and tyranny than the ancient history of athens or corinth
the portrait of the tyrant himself is just such as the later greek delighted to draw of phalaris and dionysius in which as in the lives of mediaeval saints or mythic heroes the conduct and actions of one were attributed to another in order to fill up the outline
there was no enormity which the greek was not today to believe of them the tyrant was the negation of government and law his assassination was glorious there was no crime however unnatural which might not with probability be attributed to him
in this plato was only following the common thought of his countrymen which he embellished and exaggerated with all the power of his genius
there is no need to suppose that he drew from life or that his knowledge of tyrants is derived from a personal acquaintance with dionysius
the manner in which he speaks of them would rather tend to render doubtful his ever having consorted with them or entertained the schemes which are attributed to him in the epistles of regenerating sicily by their help
plato in a hyperbolical and serio comic vein exaggerates the follies of democracy which he also sees reflected in social life
to him democracy is a state of individualism or dissolution in which every one is doing what is right in his own eyes
of a people animated by a common spirit of liberty rising as one man to repel the persian host which is the leading idea of democracy in herodotus and thucydides he never seems to think
but if he is not a believer in liberty still less is he a lover of tyranny
his deeper and more serious condemnation is reserved for the tyrant who is the ideal of wickedness and also of weakness and who in his utter helplessness and suspiciousness is leading an almost impossible existence without that remnant of good which in plato s opinion was required to give power to evil 
this ideal of wickedness living in helpless misery is the reverse of that other portrait of perfect injustice ruling in happiness and splendour which first of all thrasymachus and afterwards the sons of ariston had drawn and is also the reverse of the king whose rule of life is the good of his subjects
each of these governments and individuals has a corresponding ethical gradation the ideal state is under the rule of reason not extinguishing but harmonizing the passions and training them in virtue in the timocracy and the timocratic man the constitution whether of the state or of the individual is based first upon courage and secondly upon the love of honour this latter virtue which is hardly to be esteemed a virtue has superseded all the rest
in the second stage of decline the virtues have altogether disappeared and the love of gain has succeeded to them in the third stage or democracy the various passions are allowed to have free play and the virtues and vices are impartially cultivated
but this freedom which leads to many curious extravagances of character is in reality only a state of weakness and dissipation
at last one monster passion takes possession of the whole nature of man this is tyranny
in all of them excess the excess first of wealth and then of freedom is the element of decay
the eighth book of the republic abounds in pictures of life and fanciful allusions the use of metaphorical language is carried to a greater extent than anywhere else in plato
we may remark the description of the two nations in one which become more and more divided in the greek republics as in feudal times and perhaps also in our own the notion of democracy expressed in a sort of pythagorean formula as equality among unequals the free and easy ways of men and animals which are characteristic of liberty as foreign mercenaries and universal mistrust are of the tyrant the proposal that mere debts should not be recoverable by law is a speculation which has often been entertained by reformers of the law in modern times and is in harmony with the tendencies of modern legislation
debt and land were the two great difficulties of the ancient lawgiver in modern times we may be said to have almost if not quite solved the first of these difficulties but hardly the second
still more remarkable are the corresponding portraits of individuals there is the family picture of the father and mother and the old servant of the timocratical man and the outward respectability and inherent meanness of the oligarchical the uncontrolled licence and freedom of the democrat in which the young alcibiades seems to be depicted doing right or wrong as he pleases and who at last like the prodigal goes into a far country and there is the wild beast nature which breaks loose in his successor
the hit about the tyrant being a parricide the representation of the tyrant s life as an obscene dream the rhetorical surprise of a more miserable than the most miserable of men in book ix the hint to the poets that if they are the friends of tyrants there is no place for them in a constitutional state and that they are too clever not to see the propriety of their own expulsion the continuous image of the drones who are of two kinds swelling at last into the monster drone having wings are among plato s happiest touches
there remains to be considered the great difficulty of this book of the republic the so called number of the state
this is a puzzle almost as great as the number of the beast in the book of revelation and though apparently known to aristotle is referred to by cicero as a proverb of obscurity 
and some have imagined that there is no answer to the puzzle and that plato has been practising upon his readers
but such a deception as this is inconsistent with the manner in which aristotle speaks of the number and would have been ridiculous to any reader of the republic who was acquainted with greek mathematics
as little reason is there for supposing that plato intentionally used obscure expressions the obscurity arises from our want of familiarity with the subject
on the other hand plato himself indicates that he is not altogether serious and in describing his number as a solemn jest of the muses he appears to imply some degree of satire on the symbolical use of number
our hope of understanding the passage depends principally on an accurate study of the words themselves on which a faint light is thrown by the parallel passage in the ninth book
another help is the allusion in aristotle who makes the important remark that the latter part of the passage describes a solid figure
some further clue may be gathered from the appearance of the pythagorean triangle which is denoted by the numbers 3 4 5 and in which as in every right angled triangle the squares of the two lesser sides equal the square of the hypotenuse 
plato begins by speaking of a perfect or cyclical number i.e
a number in which the sum of the divisors equals the whole this is the divine or perfect number in which all lesser cycles or revolutions are complete
he also speaks of a human or imperfect number having four terms and three intervals of numbers which are related to one another in certain proportions these he converts into figures and finds in them when they have been raised to the third power certain elements of number which give two harmonies the one square the other oblong but he does not say that the square number answers to the divine or the oblong number to the human cycle nor is any intimation given that the first or divine number represents the period of the world the second the period of the state or of the human race as zeller supposes nor is the divine number afterwards mentioned 
the second is the number of generations or births and presides over them in the same mysterious manner in which the stars preside over them or in which according to the pythagoreans opportunity justice marriage are represented by some number or figure
this is probably the number 216
the explanation given in the text supposes the two harmonies to make up the number 8000
this explanation derives a certain plausibility from the circumstance that 8000 is the ancient number of the spartan citizens and would be what plato might have called a number which nearly concerns the population of a city the mysterious disappearance of the spartan population may possibly have suggested to him the first cause of his decline of states
the lesser or square harmony of 400 might be a symbol of the guardians the larger or oblong harmony of the people and the numbers 3 4 5 might refer respectively to the three orders in the state or parts of the soul the four virtues the five forms of government
the harmony of the musical scale which is elsewhere used as a symbol of the harmony of the state is also indicated
for the numbers 3 4 5 which represent the sides of the pythagorean triangle also denote the intervals of the scale
the terms used in the statement of the problem may be explained as follows
a perfect number as already stated is one which is equal to the sum of its divisors
thus 6 which is the first perfect or cyclical number 1 2 3
the words terms or notes and intervals are applicable to music as well as to number and figure
is the base on which the whole calculation depends or the lowest term from which it can be worked out
the words have been variously translated squared and cubed equalling and equalled in power by involution and evolution i.e
by raising the power and extracting the root 
numbers are called like and unlike when the factors or the sides of the planes and cubes which they represent are or are not in the same ratio e.g
8 and 27 2 cubed and 3 cubed and conversely
waxing numbers called also increasing are those which are exceeded by the sum of their divisors e.g
12 and 18 are less than 16 and 21
waning numbers called also decreasing are those which succeed the sum of their divisors e.g
8 and 27 exceed 7 and 13
the words translated commensurable and agreeable to one another seem to be different ways of describing the same relation with more or less precision
they are equivalent to expressible in terms having the same relation to one another like the series 8 12 18 27 each of which numbers is in the relation of to the preceding
the base or fundamental number which has 1 3 added to it 4 3 or a musical fourth
is a proportion of numbers as of musical notes applied either to the parts or factors of a single number or to the relation of one number to another
the first harmony is a square number the second harmony is an oblong number i.e
a number representing a figure of which the opposite sides only are equal
numbers squared from or upon diameters rational i.e
omitting fractions irrational i.e
including fractions e.g
49 is a square of the rational diameter of a figure the side of which 5 50 of an irrational diameter of the same
for several of the explanations here given and for a good deal besides i am indebted to an excellent article on the platonic number by dr
donaldson 
the conclusions which he draws from these data are summed up by him as follows
having assumed that the number of the perfect or divine cycle is the number of the world and the number of the imperfect cycle the number of the state he proceeds the period of the world is defined by the perfect number 6 that of the state by the cube of that number or 216 which is the product of the last pair of terms in the platonic tetractys and if we take this as the basis of our computation we shall have two cube numbers viz
8 and 27 and the mean proportionals between these viz
12 and 18 will furnish three intervals and four terms and these terms and intervals stand related to one another in the sesqui altera ratio i.e
each term is to the preceding as 3 2
now if we remember that the number 216 8 x 27 3 cubed 4 cubed 5 cubed and 3 squared 4 squared 5 squared we must admit that this number implies the numbers 3 4 5 to which musicians attach so much importance
and if we combine the ratio 4 3 with the number 5 or multiply the ratios of the sides by the hypotenuse we shall by first squaring and then cubing obtain two expressions which denote the ratio of the two last pairs of terms in the platonic tetractys the former multiplied by the square the latter by the cube of the number 10 the sum of the first four digits which constitute the platonic tetractys
the two he elsewhere explains as follows the first is in other words all squared 100 x 2 squared over 3 squared
the second a cube of the same root is described as 100 multiplied by the rational diameter of 5 diminished by unity i.e
as shown above 48 by two incommensurable diameters i.e
the two first irrationals or 2 and 3 and by the cube of 3 or 27
thus we have 100 1000 x 2 cubed
this second harmony is to be the cube of the number of which the former harmony is the square and therefore must be divided by the cube of 3
in other words the whole expression will be for the first harmony 400 9 for the second harmony 8000 27
the reasons which have inclined me to agree with dr
donaldson and also with schleiermacher in supposing that 216 is the platonic number of births are that it coincides with the description of the number given in the first part of the passage that the number 216 with its permutations would have been familiar to a greek mathematician though unfamiliar to us that 216 is the cube of 6 and also the sum of 3 cubed 4 cubed 5 cubed the numbers 3 4 5 representing the pythagorean triangle of which the sides when squared equal the square of the hypotenuse that it is also the period of the pythagorean metempsychosis the three ultimate terms or bases of which 216 is composed answer to the third fourth fifth in the musical scale that the number 216 is the product of the cubes of 2 and 3 which are the two last terms in the platonic tetractys that the pythagorean triangle is said by plutarch proclus and quintilian to be contained in this passage so that the tradition of the school seems to point in the same direction that the pythagorean triangle is called also the figure of marriage 
but though agreeing with dr
donaldson thus far i see no reason for supposing as he does that the first or perfect number is the world the human or imperfect number the state nor has he given any proof that the second harmony is a cube
nor do i think that can mean two incommensurables which he arbitrarily assumes to be 2 and 3 but rather as the preceding clause implies i.e
two square numbers based upon irrational diameters of a figure the side of which is 5 50 x 2
the greatest objection to the translation is the sense given to the words a base of three with a third added to it multiplied by 5
in this somewhat forced manner plato introduces once more the numbers of the pythagorean triangle
but the coincidences in the numbers which follow are in favour of the explanation
the first harmony of 400 as has been already remarked probably represents the rulers the second and oblong harmony of 7600 the people
and here we take leave of the difficulty
the discovery of the riddle would be useless and would throw no light on ancient mathematics
the point of interest is that plato should have used such a symbol and that so much of the pythagorean spirit should have prevailed in him
his general meaning is that divine creation is perfect and is represented or presided over by a perfect or cyclical number human generation is imperfect and represented or presided over by an imperfect number or series of numbers
the number 5040 which is the number of the citizens in the laws is expressly based by him on utilitarian grounds namely the convenience of the number for division it is also made up of the first seven digits multiplied by one another
the contrast of the perfect and imperfect number may have been easily suggested by the corrections of the cycle which were made first by meton and secondly by callippus 
of the degree of importance or of exactness to be attributed to the problem the number of the tyrant in book ix and the slight correction of the error in the number 5040 12 may furnish a criterion
there is nothing surprising in the circumstance that those who were seeking for order in nature and had found order in number should have imagined one to give law to the other
plato believes in a power of number far beyond what he could see realized in the world around him and he knows the great influence which the little matter of 1 2 3 exercises upon education
he may even be thought to have a prophetic anticipation of the discoveries of quetelet and others that numbers depend upon numbers e.g
in population the numbers of births and the respective numbers of children born of either sex on the respective ages of parents i.e
on other numbers
book ix
last of all comes the tyrannical man about whom we have to enquire whence is he and how does he live in happiness or in misery
there is however a previous question of the nature and number of the appetites which i should like to consider first
some of them are unlawful and yet admit of being chastened and weakened in various degrees by the power of reason and law
what appetites do you mean
i mean those which are awake when the reasoning powers are asleep which get up and walk about naked without any self respect or shame and there is no conceivable folly or crime however cruel or unnatural of which in imagination they may not be guilty
true he said very true
but when a man s pulse beats temperately and he has supped on a feast of reason and come to a knowledge of himself before going to rest and has satisfied his desires just enough to prevent their perturbing his reason which remains clear and luminous and when he is free from quarrel and heat the visions which he has on his bed are least irregular and abnormal
even in good men there is such an irregular wild beast nature which peers out in sleep
to return you remember what was said of the democrat that he was the son of a miserly father who encouraged the saving desires and repressed the ornamental and expensive ones presently the youth got into fine company and began to entertain a dislike to his father s narrow ways and being a better man than the corrupters of his youth he came to a mean and led a life not of lawless or slavish passion but of regular and successive indulgence
now imagine that the youth has become a father and has a son who is exposed to the same temptations and has companions who lead him into every sort of iniquity and parents and friends who try to keep him right
the counsellors of evil find that their only chance of retaining him is to implant in his soul a monster drone or love while other desires buzz around him and mystify him with sweet sounds and scents this monster love takes possession of him and puts an end to every true or modest thought or wish
love like drunkenness and madness is a tyranny and the tyrannical man whether made by nature or habit is just a drinking lusting furious sort of animal
and how does such an one live
nay that you must tell me
well then i fancy that he will live amid revelries and harlotries and love will be the lord and master of the house
many desires require much money and so he spends all that he has and borrows more and when he has nothing the young ravens are still in the nest in which they were hatched crying for food
love urges them on and they must be gratified by force or fraud or if not they become painful and troublesome and as the new pleasures succeed the old ones so will the son take possession of the goods of his parents if they show signs of refusing he will defraud and deceive them and if they openly resist what then
i can only say that i should not much like to be in their place
but o heavens adeimantus to think that for some new fangled and unnecessary love he will give up his old father and mother best and dearest of friends or enslave them to the fancies of the hour
truly a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and mother
when there is no more to be got out of them he turns burglar or pickpocket or robs a temple
love overmasters the thoughts of his youth and he becomes in sober reality the monster that he was sometimes in sleep
he waxes strong in all violence and lawlessness and is ready for any deed of daring that will supply the wants of his rabble rout
in a well ordered state there are only a few such and these in time of war go out and become the mercenaries of a tyrant
but in time of peace they stay at home and do mischief they are the thieves footpads cut purses man stealers of the community or if they are able to speak they turn false witnesses and informers
no small catalogue of crimes truly even if the perpetrators are few
yes i said but small and great are relative terms and no crimes which are committed by them approach those of the tyrant whom this class growing strong and numerous create out of themselves
if the people yield well and good but if they resist then as before he beat his father and mother so now he beats his fatherland and motherland and places his mercenaries over them
such men in their early days live with flatterers and they themselves flatter others in order to gain their ends but they soon discard their followers when they have no longer any need of them they are always either masters or servants the joys of friendship are unknown to them
and they are utterly treacherous and unjust if the nature of justice be at all understood by us
they realize our dream and he who is the most of a tyrant by nature and leads the life of a tyrant for the longest time will be the worst of them and being the worst of them will also be the most miserable
like man like state the tyrannical man will answer to tyranny which is the extreme opposite of the royal state for one is the best and the other the worst
but which is the happier
great and terrible as the tyrant may appear enthroned amid his satellites let us not be afraid to go in and ask and the answer is that the monarchical is the happiest and the tyrannical the most miserable of states
and may we not ask the same question about the men themselves requesting some one to look into them who is able to penetrate the inner nature of man and will not be panic struck by the vain pomp of tyranny
i will suppose that he is one who has lived with him and has seen him in family life or perhaps in the hour of trouble and danger
assuming that we ourselves are the impartial judge for whom we seek let us begin by comparing the individual and state and ask first of all whether the state is likely to be free or enslaved will there not be a little freedom and a great deal of slavery
and the freedom is of the bad and the slavery of the good and this applies to the man as well as to the state for his soul is full of meanness and slavery and the better part is enslaved to the worse
he cannot do what he would and his mind is full of confusion he is the very reverse of a freeman
the state will be poor and full of misery and sorrow and the man s soul will also be poor and full of sorrows and he will be the most miserable of men
no not the most miserable for there is yet a more miserable
who is that
the tyrannical man who has the misfortune also to become a public tyrant
there i suspect that you are right
say rather i am sure conjecture is out of place in an enquiry of this nature
he is like a wealthy owner of slaves only he has more of them than any private individual
you will say the owners of slaves are not generally in any fear of them
but why
because the whole city is in a league which protects the individual
suppose however that one of these owners and his household is carried off by a god into a wilderness where there are no freemen to help him will he not be in an agony of terror
will he not be compelled to flatter his slaves and to promise them many things sore against his will
and suppose the same god who carried him off were to surround him with neighbours who declare that no man ought to have slaves and that the owners of them should be punished with death
still worse and worse
he will be in the midst of his enemies
and is not our tyrant such a captive soul who is tormented by a swarm of passions which he cannot indulge living indoors always like a woman and jealous of those who can go out and see the world
having so many evils will not the most miserable of men be still more miserable in a public station
master of others when he is not master of himself like a sick man who is compelled to be an athlete the meanest of slaves and the most abject of flatterers wanting all things and never able to satisfy his desires always in fear and distraction like the state of which he is the representative
his jealous hateful faithless temper grows worse with command he is more and more faithless envious unrighteous the most wretched of men a misery to himself and to others
and so let us have a final trial and proclamation need we hire a herald or shall i proclaim the result
made the proclamation yourself
the son of ariston is of opinion that the best and justest of men is also the happiest and that this is he who is the most royal master of himself and that the unjust man is he who is the greatest tyrant of himself and of his state
and i add further seen or unseen by gods or men
this is our first proof
the second is derived from the three kinds of pleasure which answer to the three elements of the soul reason passion desire under which last is comprehended avarice as well as sensual appetite while passion includes ambition party feeling love of reputation
reason again is solely directed to the attainment of truth and careless of money and reputation
in accordance with the difference of men s natures one of these three principles is in the ascendant and they have their several pleasures corresponding to them
interrogate now the three natures and each one will be found praising his own pleasures and depreciating those of others
the money maker will contrast the vanity of knowledge with the solid advantages of wealth
the ambitious man will despise knowledge which brings no honour whereas the philosopher will regard only the fruition of truth and will call other pleasures necessary rather than good
now how shall we decide between them
is there any better criterion than experience and knowledge
and which of the three has the truest knowledge and the widest experience
the experience of youth makes the philosopher acquainted with the two kinds of desire but the avaricious and the ambitious man never taste the pleasures of truth and wisdom
honour he has equally with them they are judged of him but he is not judged of them for they never attain to the knowledge of true being
and his instrument is reason whereas their standard is only wealth and honour and if by reason we are to judge his good will be the truest
and so we arrive at the result that the pleasure of the rational part of the soul and a life passed in such pleasure is the pleasantest
he who has a right to judge judges thus
next comes the life of ambition and in the third place that of money making
twice has the just man overthrown the unjust once more as in an olympian contest first offering up a prayer to the saviour zeus let him try a fall
a wise man whispers to me that the pleasures of the wise are true and pure all others are a shadow only
let us examine this is not pleasure opposed to pain and is there not a mean state which is neither
when a man is sick nothing is more pleasant to him than health
but this he never found out while he was well
in pain he desires only to cease from pain on the other hand when he is in an ecstasy of pleasure rest is painful to him
thus rest or cessation is both pleasure and pain
but can that which is neither become both
again pleasure and pain are motions and the absence of them is rest but if so how can the absence of either of them be the other
thus we are led to infer that the contradiction is an appearance only and witchery of the senses
and these are not the only pleasures for there are others which have no preceding pains
pure pleasure then is not the absence of pain nor pure pain the absence of pleasure although most of the pleasures which reach the mind through the body are reliefs of pain and have not only their reactions when they depart but their anticipations before they come
they can be best described in a simile
there is in nature an upper lower and middle region and he who passes from the lower to the middle imagines that he is going up and is already in the upper world and if he were taken back again would think and truly think that he was descending
all this arises out of his ignorance of the true upper middle and lower regions
and a like confusion happens with pleasure and pain and with many other things
the man who compares grey with black calls grey white and the man who compares absence of pain with pain calls the absence of pain pleasure
again hunger and thirst are inanitions of the body ignorance and folly of the soul and food is the satisfaction of the one knowledge of the other
now which is the purer satisfaction that of eating and drinking or that of knowledge
consider the matter thus the satisfaction of that which has more existence is truer than of that which has less
the invariable and immortal has a more real existence than the variable and mortal and has a corresponding measure of knowledge and truth
the soul again has more existence and truth and knowledge than the body and is therefore more really satisfied and has a more natural pleasure
those who feast only on earthly food are always going at random up to the middle and down again but they never pass into the true upper world or have a taste of true pleasure
they are like fatted beasts full of gluttony and sensuality and ready to kill one another by reason of their insatiable lust for they are not filled with true being and their vessel is leaky 
their pleasures are mere shadows of pleasure mixed with pain coloured and intensified by contrast and therefore intensely desired and men go fighting about them as stesichorus says that the greeks fought about the shadow of helen at troy because they know not the truth
the same may be said of the passionate element the desires of the ambitious soul as well as of the covetous have an inferior satisfaction
only when under the guidance of reason do either of the other principles do their own business or attain the pleasure which is natural to them
when not attaining they compel the other parts of the soul to pursue a shadow of pleasure which is not theirs
and the more distant they are from philosophy and reason the more distant they will be from law and order and the more illusive will be their pleasures
the desires of love and tyranny are the farthest from law and those of the king are nearest to it
there is one genuine pleasure and two spurious ones the tyrant goes beyond even the latter he has run away altogether from law and reason
nor can the measure of his inferiority be told except in a figure
the tyrant is the third removed from the oligarch and has therefore not a shadow of his pleasure but the shadow of a shadow only
the oligarch again is thrice removed from the king and thus we get the formula 3 x 3 which is the number of a surface representing the shadow which is the tyrant s pleasure and if you like to cube this number of the beast you will find that the measure of the difference amounts to 729 the king is 729 times more happy than the tyrant
and this extraordinary number is nearly equal to the number of days and nights in a year and is therefore concerned with human life
this is the interval between a good and bad man in happiness only what must be the difference between them in comeliness of life and virtue
perhaps you may remember some one saying at the beginning of our discussion that the unjust man was profited if he had the reputation of justice
now that we know the nature of justice and injustice let us make an image of the soul which will personify his words
first of all fashion a multitudinous beast having a ring of heads of all manner of animals tame and wild and able to produce and change them at pleasure
suppose now another form of a lion and another of a man the second smaller than the first the third than the second join them together and cover them with a human skin in which they are completely concealed
when this has been done let us tell the supporter of injustice that he is feeding up the beasts and starving the man
the maintainer of justice on the other hand is trying to strengthen the man he is nourishing the gentle principle within him and making an alliance with the lion heart in order that he may be able to keep down the many headed hydra and bring all into unity with each other and with themselves
thus in every point of view whether in relation to pleasure honour or advantage the just man is right and the unjust wrong
but now let us reason with the unjust who is not intentionally in error
is not the noble that which subjects the beast to the man or rather to the god in man the ignoble that which subjects the man to the beast
and if so who would receive gold on condition that he was to degrade the noblest part of himself under the worst
who would sell his son or daughter into the hands of brutal and evil men for any amount of money
and will he sell his own fairer and diviner part without any compunction to the most godless and foul
would he not be worse than eriphyle who sold her husband s life for a necklace
and intemperance is the letting loose of the multiform monster and pride and sullenness are the growth and increase of the lion and serpent element while luxury and effeminacy are caused by a too great relaxation of spirit
flattery and meanness again arise when the spirited element is subjected to avarice and the lion is habituated to become a monkey
the real disgrace of handicraft arts is that those who are engaged in them have to flatter instead of mastering their desires therefore we say that they should be placed under the control of the better principle in another because they have none in themselves not as thrasymachus imagined to the injury of the subjects but for their good
and our intention in educating the young is to give them self control the law desires to nurse up in them a higher principle and when they have acquired this they may go their ways
what then shall a man profit if he gain the whole world and become more and more wicked
or what shall he profit by escaping discovery if the concealment of evil prevents the cure
if he had been punished the brute within him would have been silenced and the gentler element liberated and he would have united temperance justice and wisdom in his soul a union better far than any combination of bodily gifts
the man of understanding will honour knowledge above all in the next place he will keep under his body not only for the sake of health and strength but in order to attain the most perfect harmony of body and soul
in the acquisition of riches too he will aim at order and harmony he will not desire to heap up wealth without measure but he will fear that the increase of wealth will disturb the constitution of his own soul
for the same reason he will only accept such honours as will make him a better man any others he will decline
in that case said he he will never be a politician
yes but he will in his own city though probably not in his native country unless by some divine accident
you mean that he will be a citizen of the ideal city which has no place upon earth
but in heaven i replied there is a pattern of such a city and he who wishes may order his life after that image
whether such a state is or ever will be matters not he will act according to that pattern and no other
the most noticeable points in the 9th book of the republic are the account of pleasure the number of the interval which divides the king from the tyrant the pattern which is in heaven
1
plato s account of pleasure is remarkable for moderation and in this respect contrasts with the later platonists and the views which are attributed to them by aristotle
he is not like the cynics opposed to all pleasure but rather desires that the several parts of the soul shall have their natural satisfaction he even agrees with the epicureans in describing pleasure as something more than the absence of pain
this is proved by the circumstance that there are pleasures which have no antecedent pains such as the pleasures of smell and also the pleasures of hope and anticipation
in the previous book he had made the distinction between necessary and unnecessary pleasure which is repeated by aristotle and he now observes that there are a further class of wild beast pleasures corresponding to aristotle s 
he dwells upon the relative and unreal character of sensual pleasures and the illusion which arises out of the contrast of pleasure and pain pointing out the superiority of the pleasures of reason which are at rest over the fleeting pleasures of sense and emotion
the pre eminence of royal pleasure is shown by the fact that reason is able to form a judgment of the lower pleasures while the two lower parts of the soul are incapable of judging the pleasures of reason
thus in his treatment of pleasure as in many other subjects the philosophy of plato is sawn up into quantities by aristotle the analysis which was originally made by him became in the next generation the foundation of further technical distinctions
both in plato and aristotle we note the illusion under which the ancients fell of regarding the transience of pleasure as a proof of its unreality and of confounding the permanence of the intellectual pleasures with the unchangeableness of the knowledge from which they are derived
neither do we like to admit that the pleasures of knowledge though more elevating are not more lasting than other pleasures and are almost equally dependent on the accidents of our bodily state 
2
the number of the interval which separates the king from the tyrant and royal from tyrannical pleasures is 729 the cube of 9
which plato characteristically designates as a number concerned with human life because nearly equivalent to the number of days and nights in the year
he is desirous of proclaiming that the interval between them is immeasurable and invents a formula to give expression to his idea
those who spoke of justice as a cube of virtue as an art of measuring saw no inappropriateness in conceiving the soul under the figure of a line or the pleasure of the tyrant as separated from the pleasure of the king by the numerical interval of 729
and in modern times we sometimes use metaphorically what plato employed as a philosophical formula
it is not easy to estimate the loss of the tyrant except perhaps in this way says plato
so we might say that although the life of a good man is not to be compared to that of a bad man yet you may measure the difference between them by valuing one minute of the one at an hour of the other or you might say that there is an infinite difference
but this is not so much as saying in homely phrase they are a thousand miles asunder
and accordingly plato finds the natural vehicle of his thoughts in a progression of numbers this arithmetical formula he draws out with the utmost seriousness and both here and in the number of generation seems to find an additional proof of the truth of his speculation in forming the number into a geometrical figure just as persons in our own day are apt to fancy that a statement is verified when it has been only thrown into an abstract form
in speaking of the number 729 as proper to human life he probably intended to intimate that one year of the tyrannical 12 hours of the royal life
the simple observation that the comparison of two similar solids is effected by the comparison of the cubes of their sides is the mathematical groundwork of this fanciful expression
there is some difficulty in explaining the steps by which the number 729 is obtained the oligarch is removed in the third degree from the royal and aristocratical and the tyrant in the third degree from the oligarchical but we have to arrange the terms as the sides of a square and to count the oligarch twice over thus reckoning them not as 5 but as 9
the square of 9 is passed lightly over as only a step towards the cube
3
towards the close of the republic plato seems to be more and more convinced of the ideal character of his own speculations
at the end of the 9th book the pattern which is in heaven takes the place of the city of philosophers on earth
the vision which has received form and substance at his hands is now discovered to be at a distance
and yet this distant kingdom is also the rule of man s life
thus a note is struck which prepares for the revelation of a future life in the following book
but the future life is present still the ideal of politics is to be realized in the individual
book x
many things pleased me in the order of our state but there was nothing which i liked better than the regulation about poetry
the division of the soul throws a new light on our exclusion of imitation
i do not mind telling you in confidence that all poetry is an outrage on the understanding unless the hearers have that balm of knowledge which heals error
i have loved homer ever since i was a boy and even now he appears to me to be the great master of tragic poetry
but much as i love the man i love truth more and therefore i must speak out and first of all will you explain what is imitation for really i do not understand
how likely then that i should understand
that might very well be for the duller often sees better than the keener eye
true but in your presence i can hardly venture to say what i think
then suppose that we begin in our old fashion with the doctrine of universals
let us assume the existence of beds and tables
there is one idea of a bed or of a table which the maker of each had in his mind when making them he did not make the ideas of beds and tables but he made beds and tables according to the ideas
and is there not a maker of the works of all workmen who makes not only vessels but plants and animals himself the earth and heaven and things in heaven and under the earth
he makes the gods also
he must be a wizard indeed
but do you not see that there is a sense in which you could do the same
you have only to take a mirror and catch the reflection of the sun and the earth or anything else there now you have made them
yes but only in appearance
exactly so and the painter is such a creator as you are with the mirror and he is even more unreal than the carpenter although neither the carpenter nor any other artist can be supposed to make the absolute bed
not if philosophers may be believed
nor need we wonder that his bed has but an imperfect relation to the truth
reflect here are three beds one in nature which is made by god another which is made by the carpenter and the third by the painter
god only made one nor could he have made more than one for if there had been two there would always have been a third more absolute and abstract than either under which they would have been included
we may therefore conceive god to be the natural maker of the bed and in a lower sense the carpenter is also the maker but the painter is rather the imitator of what the other two make he has to do with a creation which is thrice removed from reality
and the tragic poet is an imitator and like every other imitator is thrice removed from the king and from the truth
the painter imitates not the original bed but the bed made by the carpenter
and this without being really different appears to be different and has many points of view of which only one is caught by the painter who represents everything because he represents a piece of everything and that piece an image
and he can paint any other artist although he knows nothing of their arts and this with sufficient skill to deceive children or simple people
suppose now that somebody came to us and told us how he had met a man who knew all that everybody knows and better than anybody should we not infer him to be a simpleton who having no discernment of truth and falsehood had met with a wizard or enchanter whom he fancied to be all wise
and when we hear persons saying that homer and the tragedians know all the arts and all the virtues must we not infer that they are under a similar delusion
they do not see that the poets are imitators and that their creations are only imitations
very true
but if a person could create as well as imitate he would rather leave some permanent work and not an imitation only he would rather be the receiver than the giver of praise
yes for then he would have more honour and advantage
let us now interrogate homer and the poets
friend homer say i to him i am not going to ask you about medicine or any art to which your poems incidentally refer but about their main subjects war military tactics politics
if you are only twice and not thrice removed from the truth not an imitator or an image maker please to inform us what good you have ever done to mankind
is there any city which professes to have received laws from you as sicily and italy have from charondas sparta from lycurgus athens from solon
or was any war ever carried on by your counsels
or is any invention attributed to you as there is to thales and anacharsis
or is there any homeric way of life such as the pythagorean was in which you instructed men and which is called after you
no indeed and creophylus was even more unfortunate in his breeding than he was in his name if as tradition says homer in his lifetime was allowed by him and his other friends to starve
yes but could this ever have happened if homer had really been the educator of hellas
would he not have had many devoted followers
if protagoras and prodicus can persuade their contemporaries that no one can manage house or state without them is it likely that homer and hesiod would have been allowed to go about as beggars i mean if they had really been able to do the world any good
would not men have compelled them to stay where they were or have followed them about in order to get education
but they did not and therefore we may infer that homer and all the poets are only imitators who do but imitate the appearances of things
for as a painter by a knowledge of figure and colour can paint a cobbler without any practice in cobbling so the poet can delineate any art in the colours of language and give harmony and rhythm to the cobbler and also to the general and you know how mere narration when deprived of the ornaments of metre is like a face which has lost the beauty of youth and never had any other
once more the imitator has no knowledge of reality but only of appearance
the painter paints and the artificer makes a bridle and reins but neither understands the use of them the knowledge of this is confined to the horseman and so of other things
thus we have three arts one of use another of invention a third of imitation and the user furnishes the rule to the two others
the flute player will know the good and bad flute and the maker will put faith in him but the imitator will neither know nor have faith neither science nor true opinion can be ascribed to him
imitation then is devoid of knowledge being only a kind of play or sport and the tragic and epic poets are imitators in the highest degree
and now let us enquire what is the faculty in man which answers to imitation
allow me to explain my meaning objects are differently seen when in the water and when out of the water when near and when at a distance and the painter or juggler makes use of this variation to impose upon us
and the art of measuring and weighing and calculating comes in to save our bewildered minds from the power of appearance for as we were saying two contrary opinions of the same about the same and at the same time cannot both of them be true
but which of them is true is determined by the art of calculation and this is allied to the better faculty in the soul as the arts of imitation are to the worse
and the same holds of the ear as well as of the eye of poetry as well as painting
the imitation is of actions voluntary or involuntary in which there is an expectation of a good or bad result and present experience of pleasure and pain
but is a man in harmony with himself when he is the subject of these conflicting influences
is there not rather a contradiction in him
let me further ask whether he is more likely to control sorrow when he is alone or when he is in company
in the latter case
feeling would lead him to indulge his sorrow but reason and law control him and enjoin patience since he cannot know whether his affliction is good or evil and no human thing is of any great consequence while sorrow is certainly a hindrance to good counsel
for when we stumble we should not like children make an uproar we should take the measures which reason prescribes not raising a lament but finding a cure
and the better part of us is ready to follow reason while the irrational principle is full of sorrow and distraction at the recollection of our troubles
unfortunately however this latter furnishes the chief materials of the imitative arts
whereas reason is ever in repose and cannot easily be displayed especially to a mixed multitude who have no experience of her
thus the poet is like the painter in two ways first he paints an inferior degree of truth and secondly he is concerned with an inferior part of the soul
he indulges the feelings while he enfeebles the reason and we refuse to allow him to have authority over the mind of man for he has no measure of greater and less and is a maker of images and very far gone from truth
but we have not yet mentioned the heaviest count in the indictment the power which poetry has of injuriously exciting the feelings
when we hear some passage in which a hero laments his sufferings at tedious length you know that we sympathize with him and praise the poet and yet in our own sorrows such an exhibition of feeling is regarded as effeminate and unmanly 
now ought a man to feel pleasure in seeing another do what he hates and abominates in himself
is he not giving way to a sentiment which in his own case he would control
he is off his guard because the sorrow is another s and he thinks that he may indulge his feelings without disgrace and will be the gainer by the pleasure
but the inevitable consequence is that he who begins by weeping at the sorrows of others will end by weeping at his own
the same is true of comedy you may often laugh at buffoonery which you would be ashamed to utter and the love of coarse merriment on the stage will at last turn you into a buffoon at home
poetry feeds and waters the passions and desires she lets them rule instead of ruling them
and therefore when we hear the encomiasts of homer affirming that he is the educator of hellas and that all life should be regulated by his precepts we may allow the excellence of their intentions and agree with them in thinking homer a great poet and tragedian
but we shall continue to prohibit all poetry which goes beyond hymns to the gods and praises of famous men
not pleasure and pain but law and reason shall rule in our state
these are our grounds for expelling poetry but lest she should charge us with discourtesy let us also make an apology to her
we will remind her that there is an ancient quarrel between poetry and philosophy of which there are many traces in the writings of the poets such as the saying of the she dog yelping at her mistress and the philosophers who are ready to circumvent zeus and the philosophers who are paupers
nevertheless we bear her no ill will and will gladly allow her to return upon condition that she makes a defence of herself in verse and her supporters who are not poets may speak in prose
we confess her charms but if she cannot show that she is useful as well as delightful like rational lovers we must renounce our love though endeared to us by early associations
having come to years of discretion we know that poetry is not truth and that a man should be careful how he introduces her to that state or constitution which he himself is for there is a mighty issue at stake no less than the good or evil of a human soul
and it is not worth while to forsake justice and virtue for the attractions of poetry any more than for the sake of honour or wealth
i agree with you
and yet the rewards of virtue are greater far than i have described
and can we conceive things greater still
not perhaps in this brief span of life but should an immortal being care about anything short of eternity
i do not understand what you mean
do you not know that the soul is immortal
surely you are not prepared to prove that
indeed i am
then let me hear this argument of which you make so light
you would admit that everything has an element of good and of evil
in all things there is an inherent corruption and if this cannot destroy them nothing else will
the soul too has her own corrupting principles which are injustice intemperance cowardice and the like
but none of these destroy the soul in the same sense that disease destroys the body
the soul may be full of all iniquities but is not by reason of them brought any nearer to death
nothing which was not destroyed from within ever perished by external affection of evil
the body which is one thing cannot be destroyed by food which is another unless the badness of the food is communicated to the body
neither can the soul which is one thing be corrupted by the body which is another unless she herself is infected
and as no bodily evil can infect the soul neither can any bodily evil whether disease or violence or any other destroy the soul unless it can be shown to render her unholy and unjust
but no one will ever prove that the souls of men become more unjust when they die
if a person has the audacity to say the contrary the answer is then why do criminals require the hand of the executioner and not die of themselves
truly he said injustice would not be very terrible if it brought a cessation of evil but i rather believe that the injustice which murders others may tend to quicken and stimulate the life of the unjust
you are quite right
if sin which is her own natural and inherent evil cannot destroy the soul hardly will anything else destroy her
but the soul which cannot be destroyed either by internal or external evil must be immortal and everlasting
and if this be true souls will always exist in the same number
they cannot diminish because they cannot be destroyed nor yet increase for the increase of the immortal must come from something mortal and so all would end in immortality
neither is the soul variable and diverse for that which is immortal must be of the fairest and simplest composition
if we would conceive her truly and so behold justice and injustice in their own nature she must be viewed by the light of reason pure as at birth or as she is reflected in philosophy when holding converse with the divine and immortal and eternal
in her present condition we see her only like the sea god glaucus bruised and maimed in the sea which is the world and covered with shells and stones which are incrusted upon her from the entertainments of earth
thus far as the argument required we have said nothing of the rewards and honours which the poets attribute to justice we have contented ourselves with showing that justice in herself is best for the soul in herself even if a man should put on a gyges ring and have the helmet of hades too
and now you shall repay me what you borrowed and i will enumerate the rewards of justice in life and after death
i granted for the sake of argument as you will remember that evil might perhaps escape the knowledge of gods and men although this was really impossible
and since i have shown that justice has reality you must grant me also that she has the palm of appearance
in the first place the just man is known to the gods and he is therefore the friend of the gods and he will receive at their hands every good always excepting such evil as is the necessary consequence of former sins
all things end in good to him either in life or after death even what appears to be evil for the gods have a care of him who desires to be in their likeness
and what shall we say of men
is not honesty the best policy
the clever rogue makes a great start at first but breaks down before he reaches the goal and slinks away in dishonour whereas the true runner perseveres to the end and receives the prize
and you must allow me to repeat all the blessings which you attributed to the fortunate unjust they bear rule in the city they marry and give in marriage to whom they will and the evils which you attributed to the unfortunate just do really fall in the end on the unjust although as you implied their sufferings are better veiled in silence
but all the blessings of this present life are as nothing when compared with those which await good men after death
i should like to hear about them
come then and i will tell you the story of er the son of armenius a valiant man
he was supposed to have died in battle but ten days afterwards his body was found untouched by corruption and sent home for burial
on the twelfth day he was placed on the funeral pyre and there he came to life again and told what he had seen in the world below
he said that his soul went with a great company to a place in which there were two chasms near together in the earth beneath and two corresponding chasms in the heaven above
and there were judges sitting in the intermediate space bidding the just ascend by the heavenly way on the right hand having the seal of their judgment set upon them before while the unjust having the seal behind were bidden to descend by the way on the left hand
him they told to look and listen as he was to be their messenger to men from the world below
and he beheld and saw the souls departing after judgment at either chasm some who came from earth were worn and travel stained others who came from heaven were clean and bright
they seemed glad to meet and rest awhile in the meadow here they discoursed with one another of what they had seen in the other world
those who came from earth wept at the remembrance of their sorrows but the spirits from above spoke of glorious sights and heavenly bliss
he said that for every evil deed they were punished tenfold now the journey was of a thousand years duration because the life of man was reckoned as a hundred years and the rewards of virtue were in the same proportion
he added something hardly worth repeating about infants dying almost as soon as they were born
of parricides and other murderers he had tortures still more terrible to narrate
he was present when one of the spirits asked where is ardiaeus the great
another spirit answered he comes not hither and will never come
and i myself he added actually saw this terrible sight
at the entrance of the chasm as we were about to reascend ardiaeus appeared and some other sinners most of whom had been tyrants but not all and just as they fancied that they were returning to life the chasm gave a roar and then wild fiery looking men who knew the meaning of the sound seized him and several others and bound them hand and foot and threw them down and dragged them along at the side of the road lacerating them and carding them like wool and explaining to the passers by that they were going to be cast into hell
the greatest terror of the pilgrims ascending was lest they should hear the voice and when there was silence one by one they passed up with joy
to these sufferings there were corresponding delights
on the eighth day the souls of the pilgrims resumed their journey and in four days came to a spot whence they looked down upon a line of light in colour like a rainbow only brighter and clearer
one day more brought them to the place and they saw that this was the column of light which binds together the whole universe
the ends of the column were fastened to heaven and from them hung the distaff of necessity on which all the heavenly bodies turned the hook and spindle were of adamant and the whorl of a mixed substance
the whorl was in form like a number of boxes fitting into one another with their edges turned upwards making together a single whorl which was pierced by the spindle
the outermost had the rim broadest and the inner whorls were smaller and smaller and had their rims narrower
the largest was spangled the seventh was brightest the eighth shone by the light of the seventh the second and fifth were most like one another and yellower than the eighth the third had the whitest light the fourth was red the sixth was in whiteness second
the whole had one motion but while this was revolving in one direction the seven inner circles were moving in the opposite with various degrees of swiftness and slowness
the spindle turned on the knees of necessity and a siren stood hymning upon each circle while lachesis clotho and atropos the daughters of necessity sat on thrones at equal intervals singing of past present and future responsive to the music of the sirens clotho from time to time guiding the outer circle with a touch of her right hand atropos with her left hand touching and guiding the inner circles lachesis in turn putting forth her hand from time to time to guide both of them
on their arrival the pilgrims went to lachesis and there was an interpreter who arranged them and taking from her knees lots and samples of lives got up into a pulpit and said mortal souls hear the words of lachesis the daughter of necessity
a new period of mortal life has begun and you may choose what divinity you please the responsibility of choosing is with you god is blameless
after speaking thus he cast the lots among them and each one took up the lot which fell near him
he then placed on the ground before them the samples of lives many more than the souls present and there were all sorts of lives of men and of animals
there were tyrannies ending in misery and exile and lives of men and women famous for their different qualities and also mixed lives made up of wealth and poverty sickness and health
here glaucon is the great risk of human life and therefore the whole of education should be directed to the acquisition of such a knowledge as will teach a man to refuse the evil and choose the good
he should know all the combinations which occur in life of beauty with poverty or with wealth of knowledge with external goods and at last choose with reference to the nature of the soul regarding that only as the better life which makes men better and leaving the rest
and a man must take with him an iron sense of truth and right into the world below that there too he may remain undazzled by wealth or the allurements of evil and be determined to avoid the extremes and choose the mean
for this as the messenger reported the interpreter to have said is the true happiness of man and any one as he proclaimed may if he choose with understanding have a good lot even though he come last
let not the first be careless in his choice nor the last despair
he spoke and when he had spoken he who had drawn the first lot chose a tyranny he did not see that he was fated to devour his own children and when he discovered his mistake he wept and beat his breast blaming chance and the gods and anybody rather than himself
he was one of those who had come from heaven and in his previous life had been a citizen of a well ordered state but he had only habit and no philosophy
like many another he made a bad choice because he had no experience of life whereas those who came from earth and had seen trouble were not in such a hurry to choose
but if a man had followed philosophy while upon earth and had been moderately fortunate in his lot he might not only be happy here but his pilgrimage both from and to this world would be smooth and heavenly
nothing was more curious than the spectacle of the choice at once sad and laughable and wonderful most of the souls only seeking to avoid their own condition in a previous life
he saw the soul of orpheus changing into a swan because he would not be born of a woman there was thamyras becoming a nightingale musical birds like the swan choosing to be men the twentieth soul which was that of ajax preferring the life of a lion to that of a man in remembrance of the injustice which was done to him in the judgment of the arms and agamemnon from a like enmity to human nature passing into an eagle
about the middle was the soul of atalanta choosing the honours of an athlete and next to her epeus taking the nature of a workwoman among the last was thersites who was changing himself into a monkey
thither the last of all came odysseus and sought the lot of a private man which lay neglected and despised and when he found it he went away rejoicing and said that if he had been first instead of last his choice would have been the same
men too were seen passing into animals and wild and tame animals changing into one another
when all the souls had chosen they went to lachesis who sent with each of them their genius or attendant to fulfil their lot
he first of all brought them under the hand of clotho and drew them within the revolution of the spindle impelled by her hand from her they were carried to atropos who made the threads irreversible whence without turning round they passed beneath the throne of necessity and when they had all passed they moved on in scorching heat to the plain of forgetfulness and rested at evening by the river unmindful whose water could not be retained in any vessel of this they had all to drink a certain quantity some of them drank more than was required and he who drank forgot all things
er himself was prevented from drinking
when they had gone to rest about the middle of the night there were thunderstorms and earthquakes and suddenly they were all driven divers ways shooting like stars to their birth
concerning his return to the body he only knew that awaking suddenly in the morning he found himself lying on the pyre
thus glaucon the tale has been saved and will be our salvation if we believe that the soul is immortal and hold fast to the heavenly way of justice and knowledge
so shall we pass undefiled over the river of forgetfulness and be dear to ourselves and to the gods and have a crown of reward and happiness both in this world and also in the millennial pilgrimage of the other
the tenth book of the republic of plato falls into two divisions first resuming an old thread which has been interrupted socrates assails the poets who now that the nature of the soul has been analyzed are seen to be very far gone from the truth and secondly having shown the reality of the happiness of the just he demands that appearance shall be restored to him and then proceeds to prove the immortality of the soul
the argument as in the phaedo and gorgias is supplemented by the vision of a future life
why plato who was himself a poet and whose dialogues are poems and dramas should have been hostile to the poets as a class and especially to the dramatic poets why he should not have seen that truth may be embodied in verse as well as in prose and that there are some indefinable lights and shadows of human life which can only be expressed in poetry some elements of imagination which always entwine with reason why he should have supposed epic verse to be inseparably associated with the impurities of the old hellenic mythology why he should try homer and hesiod by the unfair and prosaic test of utility are questions which have always been debated amongst students of plato
though unable to give a complete answer to them we may show first that his views arose naturally out of the circumstances of his age and secondly we may elicit the truth as well as the error which is contained in them
he is the enemy of the poets because poetry was declining in his own lifetime and a theatrocracy as he says in the laws had taken the place of an intellectual aristocracy
euripides exhibited the last phase of the tragic drama and in him plato saw the friend and apologist of tyrants and the sophist of tragedy
the old comedy was almost extinct the new had not yet arisen
dramatic and lyric poetry like every other branch of greek literature was falling under the power of rhetoric
there was no second or third to aeschylus and sophocles in the generation which followed them
aristophanes in one of his later comedies speaks of thousands of tragedy making prattlers whose attempts at poetry he compares to the chirping of swallows their garrulity went far beyond euripides they appeared once upon the stage and there was an end of them
to a man of genius who had a real appreciation of the godlike aeschylus and the noble and gentle sophocles though disagreeing with some parts of their theology these minor poets must have been contemptible and intolerable
there is no feeling stronger in the dialogues of plato than a sense of the decline and decay both in literature and in politics which marked his own age
nor can he have been expected to look with favour on the licence of aristophanes now at the end of his career who had begun by satirizing socrates in the clouds and in a similar spirit forty years afterwards had satirized the founders of ideal commonwealths in his eccleziazusae or female parliament 
there were other reasons for the antagonism of plato to poetry
the profession of an actor was regarded by him as a degradation of human nature for one man in his life cannot play many parts the characters which the actor performs seem to destroy his own character and to leave nothing which can be truly called himself
neither can any man live his life and act it
the actor is the slave of his art not the master of it
taking this view plato is more decided in his expulsion of the dramatic than of the epic poets though he must have known that the greek tragedians afforded noble lessons and examples of virtue and patriotism to which nothing in homer can be compared
but great dramatic or even great rhetorical power is hardly consistent with firmness or strength of mind and dramatic talent is often incidentally associated with a weak or dissolute character
in the tenth book plato introduces a new series of objections
first he says that the poet or painter is an imitator and in the third degree removed from the truth
his creations are not tested by rule and measure they are only appearances
in modern times we should say that art is not merely imitation but rather the expression of the ideal in forms of sense
even adopting the humble image of plato from which his argument derives a colour we should maintain that the artist may ennoble the bed which he paints by the folds of the drapery or by the feeling of home which he introduces and there have been modern painters who have imparted such an ideal interest to a blacksmith s or a carpenter s shop
the eye or mind which feels as well as sees can give dignity and pathos to a ruined mill or a straw built shed to the hull of a vessel going to its last home 
still more would this apply to the greatest works of art which seem to be the visible embodiment of the divine
had plato been asked whether the zeus or athene of pheidias was the imitation of an imitation only would he not have been compelled to admit that something more was to be found in them than in the form of any mortal and that the rule of proportion to which they conformed was higher far than any geometry or arithmetic could express
again plato objects to the imitative arts that they express the emotional rather than the rational part of human nature
he does not admit aristotle s theory that tragedy or other serious imitations are a purgation of the passions by pity and fear to him they appear only to afford the opportunity of indulging them
yet we must acknowledge that we may sometimes cure disordered emotions by giving expression to them and that they often gain strength when pent up within our own breast
it is not every indulgence of the feelings which is to be condemned
for there may be a gratification of the higher as well as of the lower thoughts which are too deep or too sad to be expressed by ourselves may find an utterance in the words of poets
every one would acknowledge that there have been times when they were consoled and elevated by beautiful music or by the sublimity of architecture or by the peacefulness of nature
plato has himself admitted in the earlier part of the republic that the arts might have the effect of harmonizing as well as of enervating the mind but in the tenth book he regards them through a stoic or puritan medium
he asks only what good have they done
and is not satisfied with the reply that they have given innocent pleasure to mankind
he tells us that he rejoices in the banishment of the poets since he has found by the analysis of the soul that they are concerned with the inferior faculties
he means to say that the higher faculties have to do with universals the lower with particulars of sense
the poets are on a level with their own age but not on a level with socrates and plato and he was well aware that homer and hesiod could not be made a rule of life by any process of legitimate interpretation his ironical use of them is in fact a denial of their authority he saw too that the poets were not critics as he says in the apology any one was a better interpreter of their writings than they were themselves
he himself ceased to be a poet when he became a disciple of socrates though as he tells us of solon he might have been one of the greatest of them if he had not been deterred by other pursuits thus from many points of view there is an antagonism between plato and the poets which was foreshadowed to him in the old quarrel between philosophy and poetry
the poets as he says in the protagoras were the sophists of their day and his dislike of the one class is reflected on the other
he regards them both as the enemies of reasoning and abstraction though in the case of euripides more with reference to his immoral sentiments about tyrants and the like
for plato is the prophet who came into the world to convince men first of the fallibility of sense and opinion and secondly of the reality of abstract ideas
whatever strangeness there may be in modern times in opposing philosophy to poetry which to us seem to have so many elements in common the strangeness will disappear if we conceive of poetry as allied to sense and of philosophy as equivalent to thought and abstraction
unfortunately the very word idea which to plato is expressive of the most real of all things is associated in our minds with an element of subjectiveness and unreality
we may note also how he differs from aristotle who declares poetry to be truer than history for the opposite reason because it is concerned with universals not like history with particulars 
the things which are seen are opposed in scripture to the things which are unseen they are equally opposed in plato to universals and ideas
to him all particulars appear to be floating about in a world of sense they have a taint of error or even of evil
there is no difficulty in seeing that this is an illusion for there is no more error or variation in an individual man horse bed etc
than in the class man horse bed etc
nor is the truth which is displayed in individual instances less certain than that which is conveyed through the medium of ideas
but plato who is deeply impressed with the real importance of universals as instruments of thought attributes to them an essential truth which is imaginary and unreal for universals may be often false and particulars true
had he attained to any clear conception of the individual which is the synthesis of the universal and the particular or had he been able to distinguish between opinion and sensation which the ambiguity of the words and the like tended to confuse he would not have denied truth to the particulars of sense
but the poets are also the representatives of falsehood and feigning in all departments of life and knowledge like the sophists and rhetoricians of the gorgias and phaedrus they are the false priests false prophets lying spirits enchanters of the world
there is another count put into the indictment against them by plato that they are the friends of the tyrant and bask in the sunshine of his patronage
despotism in all ages has had an apparatus of false ideas and false teachers at its service in the history of modern europe as well as of greece and rome
for no government of men depends solely upon force without some corruption of literature and morals some appeal to the imagination of the masses some pretence to the favour of heaven some element of good giving power to evil tyranny even for a short time cannot be maintained
the greek tyrants were not insensible to the importance of awakening in their cause a pseudo hellenic feeling they were proud of successes at the olympic games they were not devoid of the love of literature and art
plato is thinking in the first instance of greek poets who had graced the courts of dionysius or archelaus and the old spirit of freedom is roused within him at their prostitution of the tragic muse in the praises of tyranny
but his prophetic eye extends beyond them to the false teachers of other ages who are the creatures of the government under which they live
he compares the corruption of his contemporaries with the idea of a perfect society and gathers up into one mass of evil the evils and errors of mankind to him they are personified in the rhetoricians sophists poets rulers who deceive and govern the world
a further objection which plato makes to poetry and the imitative arts is that they excite the emotions
here the modern reader will be disposed to introduce a distinction which appears to have escaped him
for the emotions are neither bad nor good in themselves and are not most likely to be controlled by the attempt to eradicate them but by the moderate indulgence of them
and the vocation of art is to present thought in the form of feeling to enlist the feelings on the side of reason to inspire even for a moment courage or resignation perhaps to suggest a sense of infinity and eternity in a way which mere language is incapable of attaining
true the same power which in the purer age of art embodies gods and heroes only may be made to express the voluptuous image of a corinthian courtezan
but this only shows that art like other outward things may be turned to good and also to evil and is not more closely connected with the higher than with the lower part of the soul
all imitative art is subject to certain limitations and therefore necessarily partakes of the nature of a compromise
something of ideal truth is sacrificed for the sake of the representation and something in the exactness of the representation is sacrificed to the ideal
still works of art have a permanent element they idealize and detain the passing thought and are the intermediates between sense and ideas
in the present stage of the human mind poetry and other forms of fiction may certainly be regarded as a good
but we can also imagine the existence of an age in which a severer conception of truth has either banished or transformed them
at any rate we must admit that they hold a different place at different periods of the world s history
in the infancy of mankind poetry with the exception of proverbs is the whole of literature and the only instrument of intellectual culture in modern times she is the shadow or echo of her former self and appears to have a precarious existence
milton in his day doubted whether an epic poem was any longer possible
at the same time we must remember that what plato would have called the charms of poetry have been partly transferred to prose he himself admits rhetoric to be the handmaiden of politics and proposes to find in the strain of law a substitute for the old poets
among ourselves the creative power seems often to be growing weaker and scientific fact to be more engrossing and overpowering to the mind than formerly
the illusion of the feelings commonly called love has hitherto been the inspiring influence of modern poetry and romance and has exercised a humanizing if not a strengthening influence on the world
but may not the stimulus which love has given to fancy be some day exhausted
the modern english novel which is the most popular of all forms of reading is not more than a century or two old will the tale of love a hundred years hence after so many thousand variations of the same theme be still received with unabated interest
art cannot claim to be on a level with philosophy or religion and may often corrupt them
it is possible to conceive a mental state in which all artistic representations are regarded as a false and imperfect expression either of the religious ideal or of the philosophical ideal
the fairest forms may be revolting in certain moods of mind as is proved by the fact that the mahometans and many sects of christians have renounced the use of pictures and images
the beginning of a great religion whether christian or gentile has not been wood or stone but a spirit moving in the hearts of men
the disciples have met in a large upper room or in holes and caves of the earth in the second or third generation they have had mosques temples churches monasteries
and the revival or reform of religions like the first revelation of them has come from within and has generally disregarded external ceremonies and accompaniments
but poetry and art may also be the expression of the highest truth and the purest sentiment
plato himself seems to waver between two opposite views when as in the third book he insists that youth should be brought up amid wholesome imagery and again in book x when he banishes the poets from his republic
admitting that the arts which some of us almost deify have fallen short of their higher aim we must admit on the other hand that to banish imagination wholly would be suicidal as well as impossible
for nature too is a form of art and a breath of the fresh air or a single glance at the varying landscape would in an instant revive and reillumine the extinguished spark of poetry in the human breast
in the lower stages of civilization imagination more than reason distinguishes man from the animals and to banish art would be to banish thought to banish language to banish the expression of all truth
no religion is wholly devoid of external forms even the mahometan who renounces the use of pictures and images has a temple in which he worships the most high as solemn and beautiful as any greek or christian building
feeling too and thought are not really opposed for he who thinks must feel before he can execute
and the highest thoughts when they become familiarized to us are always tending to pass into the form of feeling
plato does not seriously intend to expel poets from life and society
but he feels strongly the unreality of their writings he is protesting against the degeneracy of poetry in his own day as we might protest against the want of serious purpose in modern fiction against the unseemliness or extravagance of some of our poets or novelists against the time serving of preachers or public writers against the regardlessness of truth which to the eye of the philosopher seems to characterize the greater part of the world
for we too have reason to complain that our poets and novelists paint inferior truth and are concerned with the inferior part of the soul that the readers of them become what they read and are injuriously affected by them
and we look in vain for that healthy atmosphere of which plato speaks the beauty which meets the sense like a breeze and imperceptibly draws the soul even in childhood into harmony with the beauty of reason
for there might be a poetry which would be the hymn of divine perfection the harmony of goodness and truth among men a strain which should renew the youth of the world and bring back the ages in which the poet was man s only teacher and best friend which would find materials in the living present as well as in the romance of the past and might subdue to the fairest forms of speech and verse the intractable materials of modern civilisation which might elicit the simple principles or as plato would have called them the essential forms of truth and justice out of the variety of opinion and the complexity of modern society which would preserve all the good of each generation and leave the bad unsung which should be based not on vain longings or faint imaginings but on a clear insight into the nature of man
then the tale of love might begin again in poetry or prose two in one united in the pursuit of knowledge or the service of god and man and feelings of love might still be the incentive to great thoughts and heroic deeds as in the days of dante or petrarch and many types of manly and womanly beauty might appear among us rising above the ordinary level of humanity and many lives which were like poems be not only written but lived by us
a few such strains have been heard among men in the tragedies of aeschylus and sophocles whom plato quotes not as homer is quoted by him in irony but with deep and serious approval in the poetry of milton and wordsworth and in passages of other english poets first and above all in the hebrew prophets and psalmists
shakespeare has taught us how great men should speak and act he has drawn characters of a wonderful purity and depth he has ennobled the human mind but like homer he has left no way of life
the next greatest poet of modern times goethe is concerned with a lower degree of truth he paints the world as a stage on which all the men and women are merely players he cultivates life as an art but he furnishes no ideals of truth and action
the poet may rebel against any attempt to set limits to his fancy and he may argue truly that moralizing in verse is not poetry
possibly like mephistopheles in faust he may retaliate on his adversaries
but the philosopher will still be justified in asking how may the heavenly gift of poesy be devoted to the good of mankind
returning to plato we may observe that a similar mixture of truth and error appears in other parts of the argument
he is aware of the absurdity of mankind framing their whole lives according to homer just as in the phaedrus he intimates the absurdity of interpreting mythology upon rational principles both these were the modern tendencies of his own age which he deservedly ridicules
on the other hand his argument that homer if he had been able to teach mankind anything worth knowing would not have been allowed by them to go about begging as a rhapsodist is both false and contrary to the spirit of plato 
it may be compared with those other paradoxes of the gorgias that no statesman was ever unjustly put to death by the city of which he was the head and that no sophist was ever defrauded by his pupils 
the argument for immortality seems to rest on the absolute dualism of soul and body
admitting the existence of the soul we know of no force which is able to put an end to her
vice is her own proper evil and if she cannot be destroyed by that she cannot be destroyed by any other
yet plato has acknowledged that the soul may be so overgrown by the incrustations of earth as to lose her original form and in the timaeus he recognizes more strongly than in the republic the influence which the body has over the mind denying even the voluntariness of human actions on the ground that they proceed from physical states 
in the republic as elsewhere he wavers between the original soul which has to be restored and the character which is developed by training and education
the vision of another world is ascribed to er the son of armenius who is said by clement of alexandria to have been zoroaster
the tale has certainly an oriental character and may be compared with the pilgrimages of the soul in the zend avesta 
but no trace of acquaintance with zoroaster is found elsewhere in plato s writings and there is no reason for giving him the name of er the pamphylian
the philosophy of heracleitus cannot be shown to be borrowed from zoroaster and still less the myths of plato
the local arrangement of the vision is less distinct than that of the phaedrus and phaedo
astronomy is mingled with symbolism and mythology the great sphere of heaven is represented under the symbol of a cylinder or box containing the seven orbits of the planets and the fixed stars this is suspended from an axis or spindle which turns on the knees of necessity the revolutions of the seven orbits contained in the cylinder are guided by the fates and their harmonious motion produces the music of the spheres
through the innermost or eighth of these which is the moon is passed the spindle but it is doubtful whether this is the continuation of the column of light from which the pilgrims contemplate the heavens the words of plato imply that they are connected but not the same
the column itself is clearly not of adamant
the spindle is fastened to the ends of the chains which extend to the middle of the column of light this column is said to hold together the heaven but whether it hangs from the spindle or is at right angles to it is not explained
the cylinder containing the orbits of the stars is almost as much a symbol as the figure of necessity turning the spindle for the outermost rim is the sphere of the fixed stars and nothing is said about the intervals of space which divide the paths of the stars in the heavens
the description is both a picture and an orrery and therefore is necessarily inconsistent with itself
the column of light is not the milky way which is neither straight nor like a rainbow but the imaginary axis of the earth
this is compared to the rainbow in respect not of form but of colour and not to the undergirders of a trireme but to the straight rope running from prow to stern in which the undergirders meet
the orrery or picture of the heavens given in the republic differs in its mode of representation from the circles of the same and of the other in the timaeus
in both the fixed stars are distinguished from the planets and they move in orbits without them although in an opposite direction in the republic as in the timaeus they are all moving round the axis of the world
but we are not certain that in the former they are moving round the earth
no distinct mention is made in the republic of the circles of the same and other although both in the timaeus and in the republic the motion of the fixed stars is supposed to coincide with the motion of the whole
the relative thickness of the rims is perhaps designed to express the relative distances of the planets
plato probably intended to represent the earth from which er and his companions are viewing the heavens as stationary in place but whether or not herself revolving unless this is implied in the revolution of the axis is uncertain 
the spectator may be supposed to look at the heavenly bodies either from above or below
the earth is a sort of earth and heaven in one like the heaven of the phaedrus on the back of which the spectator goes out to take a peep at the stars and is borne round in the revolution
there is no distinction between the equator and the ecliptic
but plato is no doubt led to imagine that the planets have an opposite motion to that of the fixed stars in order to account for their appearances in the heavens
in the description of the meadow and the retribution of the good and evil after death there are traces of homer
the description of the axis as a spindle and of the heavenly bodies as forming a whole partly arises out of the attempt to connect the motions of the heavenly bodies with the mythological image of the web or weaving of the fates
the giving of the lots the weaving of them and the making of them irreversible which are ascribed to the three fates lachesis clotho atropos are obviously derived from their names
the element of chance in human life is indicated by the order of the lots
but chance however adverse may be overcome by the wisdom of man if he knows how to choose aright there is a worse enemy to man than chance this enemy is himself
he who was moderately fortunate in the number of the lot even the very last comer might have a good life if he chose with wisdom
and as plato does not like to make an assertion which is unproven he more than confirms this statement a few sentences afterwards by the example of odysseus who chose last
but the virtue which is founded on habit is not sufficient to enable a man to choose he must add to virtue knowledge if he is to act rightly when placed in new circumstances
the routine of good actions and good habits is an inferior sort of goodness and as coleridge says common sense is intolerable which is not based on metaphysics so plato would have said habit is worthless which is not based upon philosophy
the freedom of the will to refuse the evil and to choose the good is distinctly asserted
virtue is free and as a man honours or dishonours her he will have more or less of her
the life of man is rounded by necessity there are circumstances prior to birth which affect him 
but within the walls of necessity there is an open space in which he is his own master and can study for himself the effects which the variously compounded gifts of nature or fortune have upon the soul and act accordingly
all men cannot have the first choice in everything
but the lot of all men is good enough if they choose wisely and will live diligently
the verisimilitude which is given to the pilgrimage of a thousand years by the intimation that ardiaeus had lived a thousand years before the coincidence of er coming to life on the twelfth day after he was supposed to have been dead with the seven days which the pilgrims passed in the meadow and the four days during which they journeyed to the column of light the precision with which the soul is mentioned who chose the twentieth lot the passing remarks that there was no definite character among the souls and that the souls which had chosen ill blamed any one rather than themselves or that some of the souls drank more than was necessary of the waters of forgetfulness while er himself was hindered from drinking the desire of odysseus to rest at last unlike the conception of him in dante and tennyson the feigned ignorance of how er returned to the body when the other souls went shooting like stars to their birth add greatly to the probability of the narrative
they are such touches of nature as the art of defoe might have introduced when he wished to win credibility for marvels and apparitions
there still remain to be considered some points which have been intentionally reserved to the end the janus like character of the republic which presents two faces one an hellenic state the other a kingdom of philosophers
connected with the latter of the two aspects are the paradoxes of the republic as they have been termed by morgenstern the community of property of families the rule of philosophers the analogy of the individual and the state which like some other analogies in the republic is carried too far
we may then proceed to consider the subject of education as conceived by plato bringing together in a general view the education of youth and the education of after life we may note further some essential differences between ancient and modern politics which are suggested by the republic we may compare the politicus and the laws we may observe the influence exercised by plato on his imitators and take occasion to consider the nature and value of political and of religious ideals
1
plato expressly says that he is intending to found an hellenic state 
many of his regulations are characteristically spartan such as the prohibition of gold and silver the common meals of the men the military training of the youth the gymnastic exercises of the women
the life of sparta was the life of a camp enforced even more rigidly in time of peace than in war the citizens of sparta like plato s were forbidden to trade they were to be soldiers and not shopkeepers
nowhere else in greece was the individual so completely subjected to the state the time when he was to marry the education of his children the clothes which he was to wear the food which he was to eat were all prescribed by law
some of the best enactments in the republic such as the reverence to be paid to parents and elders and some of the worst such as the exposure of deformed children are borrowed from the practice of sparta
the encouragement of friendships between men and youths or of men with one another as affording incentives to bravery is also spartan in sparta too a nearer approach was made than in any other greek state to equality of the sexes and to community of property and while there was probably less of licentiousness in the sense of immorality the tie of marriage was regarded more lightly than in the rest of greece
the suprema lex was the preservation of the family and the interest of the state
the coarse strength of a military government was not favourable to purity and refinement and the excessive strictness of some regulations seems to have produced a reaction
of all hellenes the spartans were most accessible to bribery several of the greatest of them might be described in the words of plato as having a fierce secret longing after gold and silver
though not in the strict sense communists the principle of communism was maintained among them in their division of lands in their common meals in their slaves and in the free use of one another s goods
marriage was a public institution and the women were educated by the state and sang and danced in public with the men
many traditions were preserved at sparta of the severity with which the magistrates had maintained the primitive rule of music and poetry as in the republic of plato the new fangled poet was to be expelled
hymns to the gods which are the only kind of music admitted into the ideal state were the only kind which was permitted at sparta
the spartans though an unpoetical race were nevertheless lovers of poetry they had been stirred by the elegiac strains of tyrtaeus they had crowded around hippias to hear his recitals of homer but in this they resembled the citizens of the timocratic rather than of the ideal state
the council of elder men also corresponds to the spartan gerousia and the freedom with which they are permitted to judge about matters of detail agrees with what we are told of that institution
once more the military rule of not spoiling the dead or offering arms at the temples the moderation in the pursuit of enemies the importance attached to the physical well being of the citizens the use of warfare for the sake of defence rather than of aggression are features probably suggested by the spirit and practice of sparta
to the spartan type the ideal state reverts in the first decline and the character of the individual timocrat is borrowed from the spartan citizen
the love of lacedaemon not only affected plato and xenophon but was shared by many undistinguished athenians there they seemed to find a principle which was wanting in their own democracy
the of the spartans attracted them that is to say not the goodness of their laws but the spirit of order and loyalty which prevailed
fascinated by the idea citizens of athens would imitate the lacedaemonians in their dress and manners they were known to the contemporaries of plato as the persons who had their ears bruised like the roundheads of the commonwealth
the love of another church or country when seen at a distance only the longing for an imaginary simplicity in civilized times the fond desire of a past which never has been or of a future which never will be these are aspirations of the human mind which are often felt among ourselves
such feelings meet with a response in the republic of plato
but there are other features of the platonic republic as for example the literary and philosophical education and the grace and beauty of life which are the reverse of spartan
plato wishes to give his citizens a taste of athenian freedom as well as of lacedaemonian discipline
his individual genius is purely athenian although in theory he is a lover of sparta and he is something more than either he has also a true hellenic feeling
he is desirous of humanizing the wars of hellenes against one another he acknowledges that the delphian god is the grand hereditary interpreter of all hellas
the spirit of harmony and the dorian mode are to prevail and the whole state is to have an external beauty which is the reflex of the harmony within
but he has not yet found out the truth which he afterwards enunciated in the laws that he was a better legislator who made men to be of one mind than he who trained them for war
the citizens as in other hellenic states democratic as well as aristocratic are really an upper class for although no mention is made of slaves the lower classes are allowed to fade away into the distance and are represented in the individual by the passions
plato has no idea either of a social state in which all classes are harmonized or of a federation of hellas or the world in which different nations or states have a place
his city is equipped for war rather than for peace and this would seem to be justified by the ordinary condition of hellenic states
the myth of the earth born men is an embodiment of the orthodox tradition of hellas and the allusion to the four ages of the world is also sanctioned by the authority of hesiod and the poets
thus we see that the republic is partly founded on the ideal of the old greek polis partly on the actual circumstances of hellas in that age
plato like the old painters retains the traditional form and like them he has also a vision of a city in the clouds
there is yet another thread which is interwoven in the texture of the work for the republic is not only a dorian state but a pythagorean league
the way of life which was connected with the name of pythagoras like the catholic monastic orders showed the power which the mind of an individual might exercise over his contemporaries and may have naturally suggested to plato the possibility of reviving such mediaeval institutions
the pythagoreans like plato enforced a rule of life and a moral and intellectual training
the influence ascribed to music which to us seems exaggerated is also a pythagorean feature it is not to be regarded as representing the real influence of music in the greek world
more nearly than any other government of hellas the pythagorean league of three hundred was an aristocracy of virtue
for once in the history of mankind the philosophy of order or expressing and consequently enlisting on its side the combined endeavours of the better part of the people obtained the management of public affairs and held possession of it for a considerable time 
probably only in states prepared by dorian institutions would such a league have been possible
the rulers like plato s were required to submit to a severe training in order to prepare the way for the education of the other members of the community
long after the dissolution of the order eminent pythagoreans such as archytas of tarentum retained their political influence over the cities of magna graecia
there was much here that was suggestive to the kindred spirit of plato who had doubtless meditated deeply on the way of life of pythagoras and his followers
slight traces of pythagoreanism are to be found in the mystical number of the state in the number which expresses the interval between the king and the tyrant in the doctrine of transmigration in the music of the spheres as well as in the great though secondary importance ascribed to mathematics in education
but as in his philosophy so also in the form of his state he goes far beyond the old pythagoreans
he attempts a task really impossible which is to unite the past of greek history with the future of philosophy analogous to that other impossibility which has often been the dream of christendom the attempt to unite the past history of europe with the kingdom of christ
nothing actually existing in the world at all resembles plato s ideal state nor does he himself imagine that such a state is possible
this he repeats again and again e.g
in the republic or in the laws where casting a glance back on the republic he admits that the perfect state of communism and philosophy was impossible in his own age though still to be retained as a pattern
the same doubt is implied in the earnestness with which he argues in the republic that ideals are none the worse because they cannot be realized in fact and in the chorus of laughter which like a breaking wave will as he anticipates greet the mention of his proposals though like other writers of fiction he uses all his art to give reality to his inventions
when asked how the ideal polity can come into being he answers ironically when one son of a king becomes a philosopher he designates the fiction of the earth born men as a noble lie and when the structure is finally complete he fairly tells you that his republic is a vision only which in some sense may have reality but not in the vulgar one of a reign of philosophers upon earth
it has been said that plato flies as well as walks but this falls short of the truth for he flies and walks at the same time and is in the air and on firm ground in successive instants
niebuhr has asked a trifling question which may be briefly noticed in this place was plato a good citizen
if by this is meant was he loyal to athenian institutions
he can hardly be said to be the friend of democracy but neither is he the friend of any other existing form of government all of them he regarded as states of faction none attained to his ideal of a voluntary rule over voluntary subjects which seems indeed more nearly to describe democracy than any other and the worst of them is tyranny
the truth is that the question has hardly any meaning when applied to a great philosopher whose writings are not meant for a particular age and country but for all time and all mankind
the decline of athenian politics was probably the motive which led plato to frame an ideal state and the republic may be regarded as reflecting the departing glory of hellas
as well might we complain of st
augustine whose great work the city of god originated in a similar motive for not being loyal to the roman empire
even a nearer parallel might be afforded by the first christians who cannot fairly be charged with being bad citizens because though subject to the higher powers they were looking forward to a city which is in heaven
2
the idea of the perfect state is full of paradox when judged of according to the ordinary notions of mankind
the paradoxes of one age have been said to become the commonplaces of the next but the paradoxes of plato are at least as paradoxical to us as they were to his contemporaries
the modern world has either sneered at them as absurd or denounced them as unnatural and immoral men have been pleased to find in aristotle s criticisms of them the anticipation of their own good sense
the wealthy and cultivated classes have disliked and also dreaded them they have pointed with satisfaction to the failure of efforts to realize them in practice
yet since they are the thoughts of one of the greatest of human intelligences and of one who had done most to elevate morality and religion they seem to deserve a better treatment at our hands
we may have to address the public as plato does poetry and assure them that we mean no harm to existing institutions
there are serious errors which have a side of truth and which therefore may fairly demand a careful consideration there are truths mixed with error of which we may indeed say the half is better than the whole
yet the half may be an important contribution to the study of human nature
the first paradox is the community of goods which is mentioned slightly at the end of the third book and seemingly as aristotle observes is confined to the guardians at least no mention is made of the other classes
but the omission is not of any real significance and probably arises out of the plan of the work which prevents the writer from entering into details
aristotle censures the community of property much in the spirit of modern political economy as tending to repress industry and as doing away with the spirit of benevolence
modern writers almost refuse to consider the subject which is supposed to have been long ago settled by the common opinion of mankind
but it must be remembered that the sacredness of property is a notion far more fixed in modern than in ancient times
the world has grown older and is therefore more conservative
primitive society offered many examples of land held in common either by a tribe or by a township and such may probably have been the original form of landed tenure
ancient legislators had invented various modes of dividing and preserving the divisions of land among the citizens according to aristotle there were nations who held the land in common and divided the produce and there were others who divided the land and stored the produce in common
the evils of debt and the inequality of property were far greater in ancient than in modern times and the accidents to which property was subject from war or revolution or taxation or other legislative interference were also greater
all these circumstances gave property a less fixed and sacred character
the early christians are believed to have held their property in common and the principle is sanctioned by the words of christ himself and has been maintained as a counsel of perfection in almost all ages of the church
nor have there been wanting instances of modern enthusiasts who have made a religion of communism in every age of religious excitement notions like wycliffe s inheritance of grace have tended to prevail
a like spirit but fiercer and more violent has appeared in politics
the preparation of the gospel of peace soon becomes the red flag of republicanism
we can hardly judge what effect plato s views would have upon his own contemporaries they would perhaps have seemed to them only an exaggeration of the spartan commonwealth
even modern writers would acknowledge that the right of private property is based on expediency and may be interfered with in a variety of ways for the public good
any other mode of vesting property which was found to be more advantageous would in time acquire the same basis of right the most useful in plato s words would be the most sacred
the lawyers and ecclesiastics of former ages would have spoken of property as a sacred institution
but they only meant by such language to oppose the greatest amount of resistance to any invasion of the rights of individuals and of the church
when we consider the question without any fear of immediate application to practice in the spirit of plato s republic are we quite sure that the received notions of property are the best
is the distribution of wealth which is customary in civilized countries the most favourable that can be conceived for the education and development of the mass of mankind
can the spectator of all time and all existence be quite convinced that one or two thousand years hence great changes will not have taken place in the rights of property or even that the very notion of property beyond what is necessary for personal maintenance may not have disappeared
this was a distinction familiar to aristotle though likely to be laughed at among ourselves
such a change would not be greater than some other changes through which the world has passed in the transition from ancient to modern society for example the emancipation of the serfs in russia or the abolition of slavery in america and the west indies and not so great as the difference which separates the eastern village community from the western world
to accomplish such a revolution in the course of a few centuries would imply a rate of progress not more rapid than has actually taken place during the last fifty or sixty years
the kingdom of japan underwent more change in five or six years than europe in five or six hundred
many opinions and beliefs which have been cherished among ourselves quite as strongly as the sacredness of property have passed away and the most untenable propositions respecting the right of bequests or entail have been maintained with as much fervour as the most moderate
some one will be heard to ask whether a state of society can be final in which the interests of thousands are perilled on the life or character of a single person
and many will indulge the hope that our present condition may after all be only transitional and may conduct to a higher in which property besides ministering to the enjoyment of the few may also furnish the means of the highest culture to all and will be a greater benefit to the public generally and also more under the control of public authority
there may come a time when the saying have i not a right to do what i will with my own
will appear to be a barbarous relic of individualism when the possession of a part may be a greater blessing to each and all than the possession of the whole is now to any one
such reflections appear visionary to the eye of the practical statesman but they are within the range of possibility to the philosopher
he can imagine that in some distant age or clime and through the influence of some individual the notion of common property may or might have sunk as deep into the heart of a race and have become as fixed to them as private property is to ourselves
he knows that this latter institution is not more than four or five thousand years old may not the end revert to the beginning
in our own age even utopias affect the spirit of legislation and an abstract idea may exercise a great influence on practical politics
the objections that would be generally urged against plato s community of property are the old ones of aristotle that motives for exertion would be taken away and that disputes would arise when each was dependent upon all
every man would produce as little and consume as much as he liked
the experience of civilized nations has hitherto been adverse to socialism
the effort is too great for human nature men try to live in common but the personal feeling is always breaking in
on the other hand it may be doubted whether our present notions of property are not conventional for they differ in different countries and in different states of society
we boast of an individualism which is not freedom but rather an artificial result of the industrial state of modern europe
the individual is nominally free but he is also powerless in a world bound hand and foot in the chains of economic necessity
even if we cannot expect the mass of mankind to become disinterested at any rate we observe in them a power of organization which fifty years ago would never have been suspected
the same forces which have revolutionized the political system of europe may effect a similar change in the social and industrial relations of mankind
and if we suppose the influence of some good as well as neutral motives working in the community there will be no absurdity in expecting that the mass of mankind having power and becoming enlightened about the higher possibilities of human life when they learn how much more is attainable for all than is at present the possession of a favoured few may pursue the common interest with an intelligence and persistency which mankind have hitherto never seen
now that the world has once been set in motion and is no longer held fast under the tyranny of custom and ignorance now that criticism has pierced the veil of tradition and the past no longer overpowers the present the progress of civilization may be expected to be far greater and swifter than heretofore
even at our present rate of speed the point at which we may arrive in two or three generations is beyond the power of imagination to foresee
there are forces in the world which work not in an arithmetical but in a geometrical ratio of increase
education to use the expression of plato moves like a wheel with an ever multiplying rapidity
nor can we say how great may be its influence when it becomes universal when it has been inherited by many generations when it is freed from the trammels of superstition and rightly adapted to the wants and capacities of different classes of men and women
neither do we know how much more the co operation of minds or of hands may be capable of accomplishing whether in labour or in study
the resources of the natural sciences are not half developed as yet the soil of the earth instead of growing more barren may become many times more fertile than hitherto the uses of machinery far greater and also more minute than at present
new secrets of physiology may be revealed deeply affecting human nature in its innermost recesses
the standard of health may be raised and the lives of men prolonged by sanitary and medical knowledge
there may be peace there may be leisure there may be innocent refreshments of many kinds
the ever increasing power of locomotion may join the extremes of earth
there may be mysterious workings of the human mind such as occur only at great crises of history
the east and the west may meet together and all nations may contribute their thoughts and their experience to the common stock of humanity
many other elements enter into a speculation of this kind
but it is better to make an end of them
for such reflections appear to the majority far fetched and to men of science commonplace
neither to the mind of plato nor of aristotle did the doctrine of community of property present at all the same difficulty or appear to be the same violation of the common hellenic sentiment as the community of wives and children
this paradox he prefaces by another proposal that the occupations of men and women shall be the same and that to this end they shall have a common training and education
male and female animals have the same pursuits why not also the two sexes of man
but have we not here fallen into a contradiction
for we were saying that different natures should have different pursuits
how then can men and women have the same
and is not the proposal inconsistent with our notion of the division of labour
these objections are no sooner raised than answered for according to plato there is no organic difference between men and women but only the accidental one that men beget and women bear children
following the analogy of the other animals he contends that all natural gifts are scattered about indifferently among both sexes though there may be a superiority of degree on the part of the men
the objection on the score of decency to their taking part in the same gymnastic exercises is met by plato s assertion that the existing feeling is a matter of habit
that plato should have emancipated himself from the ideas of his own country and from the example of the east shows a wonderful independence of mind
he is conscious that women are half the human race in some respects the more important half and for the sake both of men and women he desires to raise the woman to a higher level of existence
he brings not sentiment but philosophy to bear upon a question which both in ancient and modern times has been chiefly regarded in the light of custom or feeling
the greeks had noble conceptions of womanhood in the goddesses athene and artemis and in the heroines antigone and andromache
but these ideals had no counterpart in actual life
the athenian woman was in no way the equal of her husband she was not the entertainer of his guests or the mistress of his house but only his housekeeper and the mother of his children
she took no part in military or political matters nor is there any instance in the later ages of greece of a woman becoming famous in literature
hers is the greatest glory who has the least renown among men is the historian s conception of feminine excellence
a very different ideal of womanhood is held up by plato to the world she is to be the companion of the man and to share with him in the toils of war and in the cares of government
she is to be similarly trained both in bodily and mental exercises
she is to lose as far as possible the incidents of maternity and the characteristics of the female sex
the modern antagonist of the equality of the sexes would argue that the differences between men and women are not confined to the single point urged by plato that sensibility gentleness grace are the qualities of women while energy strength higher intelligence are to be looked for in men
and the criticism is just the differences affect the whole nature and are not as plato supposes confined to a single point
but neither can we say how far these differences are due to education and the opinions of mankind or physically inherited from the habits and opinions of former generations
women have been always taught not exactly that they are slaves but that they are in an inferior position which is also supposed to have compensating advantages and to this position they have conformed
it is also true that the physical form may easily change in the course of generations through the mode of life and the weakness or delicacy which was once a matter of opinion may become a physical fact
the characteristics of sex vary greatly in different countries and ranks of society and at different ages in the same individuals
plato may have been right in denying that there was any ultimate difference in the sexes of man other than that which exists in animals because all other differences may be conceived to disappear in other states of society or under different circumstances of life and training
the first wave having been passed we proceed to the second community of wives and children
is it possible
is it desirable
for as glaucon intimates and as we far more strongly insist great doubts may be entertained about both these points
any free discussion of the question is impossible and mankind are perhaps right in not allowing the ultimate bases of social life to be examined
few of us can safely enquire into the things which nature hides any more than we can dissect our own bodies
still the manner in which plato arrived at his conclusions should be considered
for here as mr
grote has remarked is a wonderful thing that one of the wisest and best of men should have entertained ideas of morality which are wholly at variance with our own
and if we would do plato justice we must examine carefully the character of his proposals
first we may observe that the relations of the sexes supposed by him are the reverse of licentious he seems rather to aim at an impossible strictness
secondly he conceives the family to be the natural enemy of the state and he entertains the serious hope that an universal brotherhood may take the place of private interests an aspiration which although not justified by experience has possessed many noble minds
on the other hand there is no sentiment or imagination in the connections which men and women are supposed by him to form human beings return to the level of the animals neither exalting to heaven nor yet abusing the natural instincts
all that world of poetry and fancy which the passion of love has called forth in modern literature and romance would have been banished by plato
the arrangements of marriage in the republic are directed to one object the improvement of the race
in successive generations a great development both of bodily and mental qualities might be possible
the analogy of animals tends to show that mankind can within certain limits receive a change of nature
and as in animals we should commonly choose the best for breeding and destroy the others so there must be a selection made of the human beings whose lives are worthy to be preserved
we start back horrified from this platonic ideal in the belief first that the higher feelings of humanity are far too strong to be crushed out secondly that if the plan could be carried into execution we should be poorly recompensed by improvements in the breed for the loss of the best things in life
the greatest regard for the weakest and meanest of human beings the infant the criminal the insane the idiot truly seems to us one of the noblest results of christianity
we have learned though as yet imperfectly that the individual man has an endless value in the sight of god and that we honour him when we honour the darkened and disfigured image of him 
this is the lesson which christ taught in a parable when he said their angels do always behold the face of my father which is in heaven
such lessons are only partially realized in any age they were foreign to the age of plato as they have very different degrees of strength in different countries or ages of the christian world
to the greek the family was a religious and customary institution binding the members together by a tie inferior in strength to that of friendship and having a less solemn and sacred sound than that of country
the relationship which existed on the lower level of custom plato imagined that he was raising to the higher level of nature and reason while from the modern and christian point of view we regard him as sanctioning murder and destroying the first principles of morality
the great error in these and similar speculations is that the difference between man and the animals is forgotten in them
the human being is regarded with the eye of a dog or bird fancier or at best of a slave owner the higher or human qualities are left out
the breeder of animals aims chiefly at size or speed or strength in a few cases at courage or temper most often the fitness of the animal for food is the great desideratum
but mankind are not bred to be eaten nor yet for their superiority in fighting or in running or in drawing carts
neither does the improvement of the human race consist merely in the increase of the bones and flesh but in the growth and enlightenment of the mind
hence there must be a marriage of true minds as well as of bodies of imagination and reason as well as of lusts and instincts
men and women without feeling or imagination are justly called brutes yet plato takes away these qualities and puts nothing in their place not even the desire of a noble offspring since parents are not to know their own children
the most important transaction of social life he who is the idealist philosopher converts into the most brutal
for the pair are to have no relation to one another except at the hymeneal festival their children are not theirs but the state s nor is any tie of affection to unite them
yet here the analogy of the animals might have saved plato from a gigantic error if he had not lost sight of his own illustration
for the nobler sort of birds and beasts nourish and protect their offspring and are faithful to one another
an eminent physiologist thinks it worth while to try and place life on a physical basis
but should not life rest on the moral rather than upon the physical
the higher comes first then the lower first the human and rational afterwards the animal
yet they are not absolutely divided and in times of sickness or moments of self indulgence they seem to be only different aspects of a common human nature which includes them both
neither is the moral the limit of the physical but the expansion and enlargement of it the highest form which the physical is capable of receiving
as plato would say the body does not take care of the body and still less of the mind but the mind takes care of both
in all human action not that which is common to man and the animals is the characteristic element but that which distinguishes him from them
even if we admit the physical basis and resolve all virtue into health of body la facon que notre sang circule still on merely physical grounds we must come back to ideas
mind and reason and duty and conscience under these or other names are always reappearing
there cannot be health of body without health of mind nor health of mind without the sense of duty and the love of truth 
that the greatest of ancient philosophers should in his regulations about marriage have fallen into the error of separating body and mind does indeed appear surprising
yet the wonder is not so much that plato should have entertained ideas of morality which to our own age are revolting but that he should have contradicted himself to an extent which is hardly credible falling in an instant from the heaven of idealism into the crudest animalism
rejoicing in the newly found gift of reflection he appears to have thought out a subject about which he had better have followed the enlightened feeling of his own age
the general sentiment of hellas was opposed to his monstrous fancy
the old poets and in later time the tragedians showed no want of respect for the family on which much of their religion was based
but the example of sparta and perhaps in some degree the tendency to defy public opinion seems to have misled him
he will make one family out of all the families of the state
he will select the finest specimens of men and women and breed from these only
yet because the illusion is always returning and also because any departure from established morality even where this is not intended is apt to be unsettling it may be worth while to draw out a little more at length the objections to the platonic marriage
in the first place history shows that wherever polygamy has been largely allowed the race has deteriorated
one man to one woman is the law of god and nature
nearly all the civilized peoples of the world at some period before the age of written records have become monogamists and the step when once taken has never been retraced
the exceptions occurring among brahmins or mahometans or the ancient persians are of that sort which may be said to prove the rule
the connexions formed between superior and inferior races hardly ever produce a noble offspring because they are licentious and because the children in such cases usually despise the mother and are neglected by the father who is ashamed of them
barbarous nations when they are introduced by europeans to vice die out polygamist peoples either import and adopt children from other countries or dwindle in numbers or both
dynasties and aristocracies which have disregarded the laws of nature have decreased in numbers and degenerated in stature mariages de convenance leave their enfeebling stamp on the offspring of them 
the marriage of near relations or the marrying in and in of the same family tends constantly to weakness or idiocy in the children sometimes assuming the form as they grow older of passionate licentiousness
the common prostitute rarely has any offspring
by such unmistakable evidence is the authority of morality asserted in the relations of the sexes and so many more elements enter into this mystery than are dreamed of by plato and some other philosophers
recent enquirers have indeed arrived at the conclusion that among primitive tribes there existed a community of wives as of property and that the captive taken by the spear was the only wife or slave whom any man was permitted to call his own
the partial existence of such customs among some of the lower races of man and the survival of peculiar ceremonies in the marriages of some civilized nations are thought to furnish a proof of similar institutions having been once universal
there can be no question that the study of anthropology has considerably changed our views respecting the first appearance of man upon the earth
we know more about the aborigines of the world than formerly but our increasing knowledge shows above all things how little we know
with all the helps which written monuments afford we do but faintly realize the condition of man two thousand or three thousand years ago
of what his condition was when removed to a distance 200 000 or 300 000 years when the majority of mankind were lower and nearer the animals than any tribe now existing upon the earth we cannot even entertain conjecture
plato and aristotle may have been more right than we imagine in supposing that some forms of civilisation were discovered and lost several times over
if we cannot argue that all barbarism is a degraded civilization neither can we set any limits to the depth of degradation to which the human race may sink through war disease or isolation
and if we are to draw inferences about the origin of marriage from the practice of barbarous nations we should also consider the remoter analogy of the animals
many birds and animals especially the carnivorous have only one mate and the love and care of offspring which seems to be natural is inconsistent with the primitive theory of marriage
if we go back to an imaginary state in which men were almost animals and the companions of them we have as much right to argue from what is animal to what is human as from the barbarous to the civilized man
the record of animal life on the globe is fragmentary the connecting links are wanting and cannot be supplied the record of social life is still more fragmentary and precarious
even if we admit that our first ancestors had no such institution as marriage still the stages by which men passed from outer barbarism to the comparative civilization of china assyria and greece or even of the ancient germans are wholly unknown to us
such speculations are apt to be unsettling because they seem to show that an institution which was thought to be a revelation from heaven is only the growth of history and experience
we ask what is the origin of marriage and we are told that like the right of property after many wars and contests it has gradually arisen out of the selfishness of barbarians
we stand face to face with human nature in its primitive nakedness
we are compelled to accept not the highest but the lowest account of the origin of human society
but on the other hand we may truly say that every step in human progress has been in the same direction and that in the course of ages the idea of marriage and of the family has been more and more defined and consecrated
the civilized east is immeasurably in advance of any savage tribes the greeks and romans have improved upon the east the christian nations have been stricter in their views of the marriage relation than any of the ancients
in this as in so many other things instead of looking back with regret to the past we should look forward with hope to the future
we must consecrate that which we believe to be the most holy and that which is the most holy will be the most useful
there is more reason for maintaining the sacredness of the marriage tie when we see the benefit of it than when we only felt a vague religious horror about the violation of it
but in all times of transition when established beliefs are being undermined there is a danger that in the passage from the old to the new we may insensibly let go the moral principle finding an excuse for listening to the voice of passion in the uncertainty of knowledge or the fluctuations of opinion
and there are many persons in our own day who enlightened by the study of anthropology and fascinated by what is new and strange some using the language of fear others of hope are inclined to believe that a time will come when through the self assertion of women or the rebellious spirit of children by the analysis of human relations or by the force of outward circumstances the ties of family life may be broken or greatly relaxed
they point to societies in america and elsewhere which tend to show that the destruction of the family need not necessarily involve the overthrow of all morality
wherever we may think of such speculations we can hardly deny that they have been more rife in this generation than in any other and whither they are tending who can predict
to the doubts and queries raised by these social reformers respecting the relation of the sexes and the moral nature of man there is a sufficient answer if any is needed
the difference about them and us is really one of fact
they are speaking of man as they wish or fancy him to be but we are speaking of him as he is
they isolate the animal part of his nature we regard him as a creature having many sides or aspects moving between good and evil striving to rise above himself and to become a little lower than the angels
we also to use a platonic formula are not ignorant of the dissatisfactions and incompatibilities of family life of the meannesses of trade of the flatteries of one class of society by another of the impediments which the family throws in the way of lofty aims and aspirations
but we are conscious that there are evils and dangers in the background greater still which are not appreciated because they are either concealed or suppressed
what a condition of man would that be in which human passions were controlled by no authority divine or human in which there was no shame or decency no higher affection overcoming or sanctifying the natural instincts but simply a rule of health
is it for this that we are asked to throw away the civilization which is the growth of ages
for strength and health are not the only qualities to be desired there are the more important considerations of mind and character and soul
we know how human nature may be degraded we do not know how by artificial means any improvement in the breed can be effected
the problem is a complex one for if we go back only four steps there are commonly thirty progenitors to be taken into account
many curious facts rarely admitting of proof are told us respecting the inheritance of disease or character from a remote ancestor
we can trace the physical resemblances of parents and children in the same family sic oculos sic ille manus sic ora ferebat but scarcely less often the differences which distinguish children both from their parents and from one another
we are told of similar mental peculiarities running in families and again of a tendency as in the animals to revert to a common or original stock
but we have a difficulty in distinguishing what is a true inheritance of genius or other qualities and what is mere imitation or the result of similar circumstances
great men and great women have rarely had great fathers and mothers
nothing that we know of in the circumstances of their birth or lineage will explain their appearance
of the english poets of the last and two preceding centuries scarcely a descendant remains none have ever been distinguished
so deeply has nature hidden her secret and so ridiculous is the fancy which has been entertained by some that we might in time by suitable marriage arrangements or as plato would have said by an ingenious system of lots produce a shakespeare or a milton
even supposing that we could breed men having the tenacity of bulldogs or like the spartans lacking the wit to run away in battle would the world be any the better
many of the noblest specimens of the human race have been among the weakest physically
tyrtaeus or aesop or our own newton would have been exposed at sparta and some of the fairest and strongest men and women have been among the wickedest and worst
not by the platonic device of uniting the strong and fair with the strong and fair regardless of sentiment and morality nor yet by his other device of combining dissimilar natures have mankind gradually passed from the brutality and licentiousness of primitive marriage to marriage christian and civilized
few persons would deny that we bring into the world an inheritance of mental and physical qualities derived first from our parents or through them from some remoter ancestor secondly from our race thirdly from the general condition of mankind into which we are born
nothing is commoner than the remark that so and so is like his father or his uncle and an aged person may not unfrequently note a resemblance in a youth to a long forgotten ancestor observing that nature sometimes skips a generation
it may be true also that if we knew more about our ancestors these similarities would be even more striking to us
admitting the facts which are thus described in a popular way we may however remark that there is no method of difference by which they can be defined or estimated and that they constitute only a small part of each individual
the doctrine of heredity may seem to take out of our hands the conduct of our own lives but it is the idea not the fact which is really terrible to us
for what we have received from our ancestors is only a fraction of what we are or may become
the knowledge that drunkenness or insanity has been prevalent in a family may be the best safeguard against their recurrence in a future generation
the parent will be most awake to the vices or diseases in his child of which he is most sensible within himself
the whole of life may be directed to their prevention or cure
the traces of consumption may become fainter or be wholly effaced the inherent tendency to vice or crime may be eradicated
and so heredity from being a curse may become a blessing
we acknowledge that in the matter of our birth as in our nature generally there are previous circumstances which affect us
but upon this platform of circumstances or within this wall of necessity we have still the power of creating a life for ourselves by the informing energy of the human will
there is another aspect of the marriage question to which plato is a stranger
all the children born in his state are foundlings
it never occurred to him that the greater part of them according to universal experience would have perished
for children can only be brought up in families
there is a subtle sympathy between the mother and the child which cannot be supplied by other mothers or by strong nurses one or more 
if plato s pen was as fatal as the creches of paris or the foundling hospital of dublin more than nine tenths of his children would have perished
there would have been no need to expose or put out of the way the weaklier children for they would have died of themselves
so emphatically does nature protest against the destruction of the family
what plato had heard or seen of sparta was applied by him in a mistaken way to his ideal commonwealth
he probably observed that both the spartan men and women were superior in form and strength to the other greeks and this superiority he was disposed to attribute to the laws and customs relating to marriage
he did not consider that the desire of a noble offspring was a passion among the spartans or that their physical superiority was to be attributed chiefly not to their marriage customs but to their temperance and training
he did not reflect that sparta was great not in consequence of the relaxation of morality but in spite of it by virtue of a political principle stronger far than existed in any other grecian state
least of all did he observe that sparta did not really produce the finest specimens of the greek race
the genius the political inspiration of athens the love of liberty all that has made greece famous with posterity were wanting among the spartans
they had no themistocles or pericles or aeschylus or sophocles or socrates or plato
the individual was not allowed to appear above the state the laws were fixed and he had no business to alter or reform them
yet whence has the progress of cities and nations arisen if not from remarkable individuals coming into the world we know not how and from causes over which we have no control
something too much may have been said in modern times of the value of individuality
but we can hardly condemn too strongly a system which instead of fostering the scattered seeds or sparks of genius and character tends to smother and extinguish them
still while condemning plato we must acknowledge that neither christianity nor any other form of religion and society has hitherto been able to cope with this most difficult of social problems and that the side from which plato regarded it is that from which we turn away
population is the most untameable force in the political and social world
do we not find especially in large cities that the greatest hindrance to the amelioration of the poor is their improvidence in marriage
a small fault truly if not involving endless consequences
there are whole countries too such as india or nearer home ireland in which a right solution of the marriage question seems to lie at the foundation of the happiness of the community
there are too many people on a given space or they marry too early and bring into the world a sickly and half developed offspring or owing to the very conditions of their existence they become emaciated and hand on a similar life to their descendants
but who can oppose the voice of prudence to the mightiest passions of mankind especially when they have been licensed by custom and religion
in addition to the influences of education we seem to require some new principles of right and wrong in these matters some force of opinion which may indeed be already heard whispering in private but has never affected the moral sentiments of mankind in general
we unavoidably lose sight of the principle of utility just in that action of our lives in which we have the most need of it
the influences which we can bring to bear upon this question are chiefly indirect
in a generation or two education emigration improvements in agriculture and manufactures may have provided the solution
the state physician hardly likes to probe the wound it is beyond his art a matter which he cannot safely let alone but which he dare not touch we do but skin and film the ulcerous place
when again in private life we see a whole family one by one dropping into the grave under the ate of some inherited malady and the parents perhaps surviving them do our minds ever go back silently to that day twenty five or thirty years before on which under the fairest auspices amid the rejoicings of friends and acquaintances a bride and bridegroom joined hands with one another
in making such a reflection we are not opposing physical considerations to moral but moral to physical we are seeking to make the voice of reason heard which drives us back from the extravagance of sentimentalism on common sense
the late dr
combe is said by his biographer to have resisted the temptation to marriage because he knew that he was subject to hereditary consumption
one who deserved to be called a man of genius a friend of my youth was in the habit of wearing a black ribbon on his wrist in order to remind him that being liable to outbreaks of insanity he must not give way to the natural impulses of affection he died unmarried in a lunatic asylum
these two little facts suggest the reflection that a very few persons have done from a sense of duty what the rest of mankind ought to have done under like circumstances if they had allowed themselves to think of all the misery which they were about to bring into the world
if we could prevent such marriages without any violation of feeling or propriety we clearly ought and the prohibition in the course of time would be protected by a horror naturalis similar to that which in all civilized ages and countries has prevented the marriage of near relations by blood
mankind would have been the happier if some things which are now allowed had from the beginning been denied to them if the sanction of religion could have prohibited practices inimical to health if sanitary principles could in early ages have been invested with a superstitious awe
but living as we do far on in the world s history we are no longer able to stamp at once with the impress of religion a new prohibition
a free agent cannot have his fancies regulated by law and the execution of the law would be rendered impossible owing to the uncertainty of the cases in which marriage was to be forbidden
who can weigh virtue or even fortune against health or moral and mental qualities against bodily
who can measure probabilities against certainties
there has been some good as well as evil in the discipline of suffering and there are diseases such as consumption which have exercised a refining and softening influence on the character
youth is too inexperienced to balance such nice considerations parents do not often think of them or think of them too late
they are at a distance and may probably be averted change of place a new state of life the interests of a home may be the cure of them
so persons vainly reason when their minds are already made up and their fortunes irrevocably linked together
nor is there any ground for supposing that marriages are to any great extent influenced by reflections of this sort which seem unable to make any head against the irresistible impulse of individual attachment
lastly no one can have observed the first rising flood of the passions in youth the difficulty of regulating them and the effects on the whole mind and nature which follow from them the stimulus which is given to them by the imagination without feeling that there is something unsatisfactory in our method of treating them
that the most important influence on human life should be wholly left to chance or shrouded in mystery and instead of being disciplined or understood should be required to conform only to an external standard of propriety cannot be regarded by the philosopher as a safe or satisfactory condition of human things
and still those who have the charge of youth may find a way by watchfulness by affection by the manliness and innocence of their own lives by occasional hints by general admonitions which every one can apply for himself to mitigate this terrible evil which eats out the heart of individuals and corrupts the moral sentiments of nations
in no duty towards others is there more need of reticence and self restraint
so great is the danger lest he who would be the counsellor of another should reveal the secret prematurely lest he should get another too much into his power or fix the passing impression of evil by demanding the confession of it
nor is plato wrong in asserting that family attachments may interfere with higher aims
if there have been some who to party gave up what was meant for mankind there have certainly been others who to family gave up what was meant for mankind or for their country
the cares of children the necessity of procuring money for their support the flatteries of the rich by the poor the exclusiveness of caste the pride of birth or wealth the tendency of family life to divert men from the pursuit of the ideal or the heroic are as lowering in our own age as in that of plato
and if we prefer to look at the gentle influences of home the development of the affections the amenities of society the devotion of one member of a family for the good of the others which form one side of the picture we must not quarrel with him or perhaps ought rather to be grateful to him for having presented to us the reverse
without attempting to defend plato on grounds of morality we may allow that there is an aspect of the world which has not unnaturally led him into error
we hardly appreciate the power which the idea of the state like all other abstract ideas exercised over the mind of plato
to us the state seems to be built up out of the family or sometimes to be the framework in which family and social life is contained
but to plato in his present mood of mind the family is only a disturbing influence which instead of filling up tends to disarrange the higher unity of the state
no organization is needed except a political which regarded from another point of view is a military one
the state is all sufficing for the wants of man and like the idea of the church in later ages absorbs all other desires and affections
in time of war the thousand citizens are to stand like a rampart impregnable against the world or the persian host in time of peace the preparation for war and their duties to the state which are also their duties to one another take up their whole life and time
the only other interest which is allowed to them besides that of war is the interest of philosophy
when they are too old to be soldiers they are to retire from active life and to have a second novitiate of study and contemplation
there is an element of monasticism even in plato s communism
if he could have done without children he might have converted his republic into a religious order
neither in the laws when the daylight of common sense breaks in upon him does he retract his error
in the state of which he would be the founder there is no marrying or giving in marriage but because of the infirmity of mankind he condescends to allow the law of nature to prevail
but plato has an equal or in his own estimation even greater paradox in reserve which is summed up in the famous text until kings are philosophers or philosophers are kings cities will never cease from ill
and by philosophers he explains himself to mean those who are capable of apprehending ideas especially the idea of good
to the attainment of this higher knowledge the second education is directed
through a process of training which has already made them good citizens they are now to be made good legislators
we find with some surprise that plato does not propose for his future legislators any study of finance or law or military tactics but only of abstract mathematics as a preparation for the still more abstract conception of good
we ask with aristotle what is the use of a man knowing the idea of good if he does not know what is good for this individual this state this condition of society
we cannot understand how plato s legislators or guardians are to be fitted for their work of statesmen by the study of the five mathematical sciences
we vainly search in plato s own writings for any explanation of this seeming absurdity
the discovery of a great metaphysical conception seems to ravish the mind with a prophetic consciousness which takes away the power of estimating its value
no metaphysical enquirer has ever fairly criticised his own speculations in his own judgment they have been above criticism nor has he understood that what to him seemed to be absolute truth may reappear in the next generation as a form of logic or an instrument of thought
and posterity have also sometimes equally misapprehended the real value of his speculations
they appear to them to have contributed nothing to the stock of human knowledge
the idea of good is apt to be regarded by the modern thinker as an unmeaning abstraction but he forgets that this abstraction is waiting ready for use and will hereafter be filled up by the divisions of knowledge
when mankind do not as yet know that the world is subject to law the introduction of the mere conception of law or design or final cause and the far off anticipation of the harmony of knowledge are great steps onward
even the crude generalization of the unity of all things leads men to view the world with different eyes and may easily affect their conception of human life and of politics and also their own conduct and character 
we can imagine how a great mind like that of pericles might derive elevation from his intercourse with anaxagoras 
to be struggling towards a higher but unattainable conception is a more favourable intellectual condition than to rest satisfied in a narrow portion of ascertained fact
and the earlier which have sometimes been the greater ideas of science are often lost sight of at a later period
how rarely can we say of any modern enquirer in the magnificent language of plato that he is the spectator of all time and of all existence
nor is there anything unnatural in the hasty application of these vast metaphysical conceptions to practical and political life
in the first enthusiasm of ideas men are apt to see them everywhere and to apply them in the most remote sphere
they do not understand that the experience of ages is required to enable them to fill up the intermediate axioms
plato himself seems to have imagined that the truths of psychology like those of astronomy and harmonics would be arrived at by a process of deduction and that the method which he has pursued in the fourth book of inferring them from experience and the use of language was imperfect and only provisional
but when after having arrived at the idea of good which is the end of the science of dialectic he is asked what is the nature and what are the divisions of the science
he refuses to answer as if intending by the refusal to intimate that the state of knowledge which then existed was not such as would allow the philosopher to enter into his final rest
the previous sciences must first be studied and will we may add continue to be studied tell the end of time although in a sense different from any which plato could have conceived
but we may observe that while he is aware of the vacancy of his own ideal he is full of enthusiasm in the contemplation of it
looking into the orb of light he sees nothing but he is warmed and elevated
the hebrew prophet believed that faith in god would enable him to govern the world the greek philosopher imagined that contemplation of the good would make a legislator
there is as much to be filled up in the one case as in the other and the one mode of conception is to the israelite what the other is to the greek
both find a repose in a divine perfection which whether in a more personal or impersonal form exists without them and independently of them as well as within them
there is no mention of the idea of good in the timaeus nor of the divine creator of the world in the republic and we are naturally led to ask in what relation they stand to one another
is god above or below the idea of good
or is the idea of good another mode of conceiving god
the latter appears to be the truer answer
to the greek philosopher the perfection and unity of god was a far higher conception than his personality which he hardly found a word to express and which to him would have seemed to be borrowed from mythology
to the christian on the other hand or to the modern thinker in general it is difficult if not impossible to attach reality to what he terms mere abstraction while to plato this very abstraction is the truest and most real of all things
hence from a difference in forms of thought plato appears to be resting on a creation of his own mind only
but if we may be allowed to paraphrase the idea of good by the words intelligent principle of law and order in the universe embracing equally man and nature we begin to find a meeting point between him and ourselves
the question whether the ruler or statesman should be a philosopher is one that has not lost interest in modern times
in most countries of europe and asia there has been some one in the course of ages who has truly united the power of command with the power of thought and reflection as there have been also many false combinations of these qualities
some kind of speculative power is necessary both in practical and political life like the rhetorician in the phaedrus men require to have a conception of the varieties of human character and to be raised on great occasions above the commonplaces of ordinary life
yet the idea of the philosopher statesman has never been popular with the mass of mankind partly because he cannot take the world into his confidence or make them understand the motives from which he acts and also because they are jealous of a power which they do not understand
the revolution which human nature desires to effect step by step in many ages is likely to be precipitated by him in a single year or life
they are afraid that in the pursuit of his greater aims he may disregard the common feelings of humanity he is too apt to be looking into the distant future or back into the remote past and unable to see actions or events which to use an expression of plato s are tumbling out at his feet
besides as plato would say there are other corruptions of these philosophical statesmen
either the native hue of resolution is sicklied o er with the pale cast of thought and at the moment when action above all things is required he is undecided or general principles are enunciated by him in order to cover some change of policy or his ignorance of the world has made him more easily fall a prey to the arts of others or in some cases he has been converted into a courtier who enjoys the luxury of holding liberal opinions but was never known to perform a liberal action
no wonder that mankind have been in the habit of calling statesmen of this class pedants sophisters doctrinaires visionaries
for as we may be allowed to say a little parodying the words of plato they have seen bad imitations of the philosopher statesman
but a man in whom the power of thought and action are perfectly balanced equal to the present reaching forward to the future such a one ruling in a constitutional state they have never seen
but as the philosopher is apt to fail in the routine of political life so the ordinary statesman is also apt to fail in extraordinary crises
when the face of the world is beginning to alter and thunder is heard in the distance he is still guided by his old maxims and is the slave of his inveterate party prejudices he cannot perceive the signs of the times instead of looking forward he looks back he learns nothing and forgets nothing with wise saws and modern instances he would stem the rising tide of revolution
he lives more and more within the circle of his own party as the world without him becomes stronger
this seems to be the reason why the old order of things makes so poor a figure when confronted with the new why churches can never reform why most political changes are made blindly and convulsively
the great crises in the history of nations have often been met by an ecclesiastical positiveness and a more obstinate reassertion of principles which have lost their hold upon a nation
the fixed ideas of a reactionary statesman may be compared to madness they grow upon him and he becomes possessed by them no judgement of others is ever admitted by him to be weighed in the balance against his own
plato labouring under what to modern readers appears to have been a confusion of ideas assimilates the state to the individual and fails to distinguish ethics from politics
he thinks that to be most of a state which is most like one man and in which the citizens have the greatest uniformity of character
he does not see that the analogy is partly fallacious and that the will or character of a state or nation is really the balance or rather the surplus of individual wills which are limited by the condition of having to act in common
the movement of a body of men can never have the pliancy or facility of a single man the freedom of the individual which is always limited becomes still more straitened when transferred to a nation
the powers of action and feeling are necessarily weaker and more balanced when they are diffused through a community whence arises the often discussed question can a nation like an individual have a conscience
we hesitate to say that the characters of nations are nothing more than the sum of the characters of the individuals who compose them because there may be tendencies in individuals which react upon one another
a whole nation may be wiser than any one man in it or may be animated by some common opinion or feeling which could not equally have affected the mind of a single person or may have been inspired by a leader of genius to perform acts more than human
plato does not appear to have analysed the complications which arise out of the collective action of mankind
neither is he capable of seeing that analogies though specious as arguments may often have no foundation in fact or of distinguishing between what is intelligible or vividly present to the mind and what is true
in this respect he is far below aristotle who is comparatively seldom imposed upon by false analogies
he cannot disentangle the arts from the virtues at least he is always arguing from one to the other
his notion of music is transferred from harmony of sounds to harmony of life in this he is assisted by the ambiguities of language as well as by the prevalence of pythagorean notions
and having once assimilated the state to the individual he imagines that he will find the succession of states paralleled in the lives of individuals
still through this fallacious medium a real enlargement of ideas is attained
when the virtues as yet presented no distinct conception to the mind a great advance was made by the comparison of them with the arts for virtue is partly art and has an outward form as well as an inward principle
the harmony of music affords a lively image of the harmonies of the world and of human life and may be regarded as a splendid illustration which was naturally mistaken for a real analogy
in the same way the identification of ethics with politics has a tendency to give definiteness to ethics and also to elevate and ennoble men s notions of the aims of government and of the duties of citizens for ethics from one point of view may be conceived as an idealized law and politics and politics as ethics reduced to the conditions of human society
there have been evils which have arisen out of the attempt to identify them and this has led to the separation or antagonism of them which has been introduced by modern political writers
but we may likewise feel that something has been lost in their separation and that the ancient philosophers who estimated the moral and intellectual wellbeing of mankind first and the wealth of nations and individuals second may have a salutary influence on the speculations of modern times
many political maxims originate in a reaction against an opposite error and when the errors against which they were directed have passed away they in turn become errors

plato s views of education are in several respects remarkable like the rest of the republic they are partly greek and partly ideal beginning with the ordinary curriculum of the greek youth and extending to after life
plato is the first writer who distinctly says that education is to comprehend the whole of life and to be a preparation for another in which education begins again
this is the continuous thread which runs through the republic and which more than any other of his ideas admits of an application to modern life
he has long given up the notion that virtue cannot be taught and he is disposed to modify the thesis of the protagoras that the virtues are one and not many
he is not unwilling to admit the sensible world into his scheme of truth
nor does he assert in the republic the involuntariness of vice which is maintained by him in the timaeus sophist and laws 
nor do the so called platonic ideas recovered from a former state of existence affect his theory of mental improvement
still we observe in him the remains of the old socratic doctrine that true knowledge must be elicited from within and is to be sought for in ideas not in particulars of sense
education as he says will implant a principle of intelligence which is better than ten thousand eyes
the paradox that the virtues are one and the kindred notion that all virtue is knowledge are not entirely renounced the first is seen in the supremacy given to justice over the rest the second in the tendency to absorb the moral virtues in the intellectual and to centre all goodness in the contemplation of the idea of good
the world of sense is still depreciated and identified with opinion though admitted to be a shadow of the true
in the republic he is evidently impressed with the conviction that vice arises chiefly from ignorance and may be cured by education the multitude are hardly to be deemed responsible for what they do
a faint allusion to the doctrine of reminiscence occurs in the tenth book but plato s views of education have no more real connection with a previous state of existence than our own he only proposes to elicit from the mind that which is there already
education is represented by him not as the filling of a vessel but as the turning the eye of the soul towards the light
he treats first of music or literature which he divides into true and false and then goes on to gymnastics of infancy in the republic he takes no notice though in the laws he gives sage counsels about the nursing of children and the management of the mothers and would have an education which is even prior to birth
but in the republic he begins with the age at which the child is capable of receiving ideas and boldly asserts in language which sounds paradoxical to modern ears that he must be taught the false before he can learn the true
the modern and ancient philosophical world are not agreed about truth and falsehood the one identifies truth almost exclusively with fact the other with ideas
this is the difference between ourselves and plato which is however partly a difference of words
for we too should admit that a child must receive many lessons which he imperfectly understands he must be taught some things in a figure only some too which he can hardly be expected to believe when he grows older but we should limit the use of fiction by the necessity of the case
plato would draw the line differently according to him the aim of early education is not truth as a matter of fact but truth as a matter of principle the child is to be taught first simple religious truths and then simple moral truths and insensibly to learn the lesson of good manners and good taste
he would make an entire reformation of the old mythology like xenophanes and heracleitus he is sensible of the deep chasm which separates his own age from homer and hesiod whom he quotes and invests with an imaginary authority but only for his own purposes
the lusts and treacheries of the gods are to be banished the terrors of the world below are to be dispelled the misbehaviour of the homeric heroes is not to be a model for youth
but there is another strain heard in homer which may teach our youth endurance and something may be learnt in medicine from the simple practice of the homeric age
the principles on which religion is to be based are two only first that god is true secondly that he is good
modern and christian writers have often fallen short of these they can hardly be said to have gone beyond them
the young are to be brought up in happy surroundings out of the way of sights or sounds which may hurt the character or vitiate the taste
they are to live in an atmosphere of health the breeze is always to be wafting to them the impressions of truth and goodness
could such an education be realized or if our modern religious education could be bound up with truth and virtue and good manners and good taste that would be the best hope of human improvement
plato like ourselves is looking forward to changes in the moral and religious world and is preparing for them
he recognizes the danger of unsettling young men s minds by sudden changes of laws and principles by destroying the sacredness of one set of ideas when there is nothing else to take their place
he is afraid too of the influence of the drama on the ground that it encourages false sentiment and therefore he would not have his children taken to the theatre he thinks that the effect on the spectators is bad and on the actors still worse
his idea of education is that of harmonious growth in which are insensibly learnt the lessons of temperance and endurance and the body and mind develope in equal proportions
the first principle which runs through all art and nature is simplicity this also is to be the rule of human life
the second stage of education is gymnastic which answers to the period of muscular growth and development
the simplicity which is enforced in music is extended to gymnastic plato is aware that the training of the body may be inconsistent with the training of the mind and that bodily exercise may be easily overdone
excessive training of the body is apt to give men a headache or to render them sleepy at a lecture on philosophy and this they attribute not to the true cause but to the nature of the subject
two points are noticeable in plato s treatment of gymnastic first that the time of training is entirely separated from the time of literary education
he seems to have thought that two things of an opposite and different nature could not be learnt at the same time
here we can hardly agree with him and if we may judge by experience the effect of spending three years between the ages of fourteen and seventeen in mere bodily exercise would be far from improving to the intellect
secondly he affirms that music and gymnastic are not as common opinion is apt to imagine intended the one for the cultivation of the mind and the other of the body but that they are both equally designed for the improvement of the mind
the body in his view is the servant of the mind the subjection of the lower to the higher is for the advantage of both
and doubtless the mind may exercise a very great and paramount influence over the body if exerted not at particular moments and by fits and starts but continuously in making preparation for the whole of life
other greek writers saw the mischievous tendency of spartan discipline 
but only plato recognized the fundamental error on which the practice was based
the subject of gymnastic leads plato to the sister subject of medicine which he further illustrates by the parallel of law
the modern disbelief in medicine has led in this as in some other departments of knowledge to a demand for greater simplicity physicians are becoming aware that they often make diseases greater and more complicated by their treatment of them 
in two thousand years their art has made but slender progress what they have gained in the analysis of the parts is in a great degree lost by their feebler conception of the human frame as a whole
they have attended more to the cure of diseases than to the conditions of health and the improvements in medicine have been more than counterbalanced by the disuse of regular training
until lately they have hardly thought of air and water the importance of which was well understood by the ancients as aristotle remarks air and water being the elements which we most use have the greatest effect upon health 
for ages physicians have been under the dominion of prejudices which have only recently given way and now there are as many opinions in medicine as in theology and an equal degree of scepticism and some want of toleration about both
plato has several good notions about medicine according to him the eye cannot be cured without the rest of the body nor the body without the mind 
no man of sense he says in the timaeus would take physic and we heartily sympathize with him in the laws when he declares that the limbs of the rustic worn with toil will derive more benefit from warm baths than from the prescriptions of a not over wise doctor
but we can hardly praise him when in obedience to the authority of homer he depreciates diet or approve of the inhuman spirit in which he would get rid of invalid and useless lives by leaving them to die
he does not seem to have considered that the bridle of theages might be accompanied by qualities which were of far more value to the state than the health or strength of the citizens or that the duty of taking care of the helpless might be an important element of education in a state
the physician himself should not be a man in robust health he should have in modern phraseology a nervous temperament he should have experience of disease in his own person in order that his powers of observation may be quickened in the case of others
the perplexity of medicine is paralleled by the perplexity of law in which again plato would have men follow the golden rule of simplicity
greater matters are to be determined by the legislator or by the oracle of delphi lesser matters are to be left to the temporary regulation of the citizens themselves
plato is aware that laissez faire is an important element of government
the diseases of a state are like the heads of a hydra they multiply when they are cut off
the true remedy for them is not extirpation but prevention
and the way to prevent them is to take care of education and education will take care of all the rest
so in modern times men have often felt that the only political measure worth having the only one which would produce any certain or lasting effect was a measure of national education
and in our own more than in any previous age the necessity has been recognized of restoring the ever increasing confusion of law to simplicity and common sense
when the training in music and gymnastic is completed there follows the first stage of active and public life
but soon education is to begin again from a new point of view
in the interval between the fourth and seventh books we have discussed the nature of knowledge and have thence been led to form a higher conception of what was required of us
for true knowledge according to plato is of abstractions and has to do not with particulars or individuals but with universals only not with the beauties of poetry but with the ideas of philosophy
and the great aim of education is the cultivation of the habit of abstraction
this is to be acquired through the study of the mathematical sciences
they alone are capable of giving ideas of relation and of arousing the dormant energies of thought
mathematics in the age of plato comprehended a very small part of that which is now included in them but they bore a much larger proportion to the sum of human knowledge
they were the only organon of thought which the human mind at that time possessed and the only measure by which the chaos of particulars could be reduced to rule and order
the faculty which they trained was naturally at war with the poetical or imaginative and hence to plato who is everywhere seeking for abstractions and trying to get rid of the illusions of sense nearly the whole of education is contained in them
they seemed to have an inexhaustible application partly because their true limits were not yet understood
these plato himself is beginning to investigate though not aware that number and figure are mere abstractions of sense he recognizes that the forms used by geometry are borrowed from the sensible world
he seeks to find the ultimate ground of mathematical ideas in the idea of good though he does not satisfactorily explain the connexion between them and in his conception of the relation of ideas to numbers he falls very far short of the definiteness attributed to him by aristotle 
but if he fails to recognize the true limits of mathematics he also reaches a point beyond them in his view ideas of number become secondary to a higher conception of knowledge
the dialectician is as much above the mathematician as the mathematician is above the ordinary man
the one the self proving the good which is the higher sphere of dialectic is the perfect truth to which all things ascend and in which they finally repose
this self proving unity or idea of good is a mere vision of which no distinct explanation can be given relative only to a particular stage in greek philosophy
it is an abstraction under which no individuals are comprehended a whole which has no parts 
the vacancy of such a form was perceived by aristotle but not by plato
nor did he recognize that in the dialectical process are included two or more methods of investigation which are at variance with each other
he did not see that whether he took the longer or the shorter road no advance could be made in this way
and yet such visions often have an immense effect for although the method of science cannot anticipate science the idea of science not as it is but as it will be in the future is a great and inspiring principle
in the pursuit of knowledge we are always pressing forward to something beyond us and as a false conception of knowledge for example the scholastic philosophy may lead men astray during many ages so the true ideal though vacant may draw all their thoughts in a right direction
it makes a great difference whether the general expectation of knowledge as this indefinite feeling may be termed is based upon a sound judgment
for mankind may often entertain a true conception of what knowledge ought to be when they have but a slender experience of facts
the correlation of the sciences the consciousness of the unity of nature the idea of classification the sense of proportion the unwillingness to stop short of certainty or to confound probability with truth are important principles of the higher education
although plato could tell us nothing and perhaps knew that he could tell us nothing of the absolute truth he has exercised an influence on the human mind which even at the present day is not exhausted and political and social questions may yet arise in which the thoughts of plato may be read anew and receive a fresh meaning
the idea of good is so called only in the republic but there are traces of it in other dialogues of plato
it is a cause as well as an idea and from this point of view may be compared with the creator of the timaeus who out of his goodness created all things
it corresponds to a certain extent with the modern conception of a law of nature or of a final cause or of both in one and in this regard may be connected with the measure and symmetry of the philebus
it is represented in the symposium under the aspect of beauty and is supposed to be attained there by stages of initiation as here by regular gradations of knowledge
viewed subjectively it is the process or science of dialectic
this is the science which according to the phaedrus is the true basis of rhetoric which alone is able to distinguish the natures and classes of men and things which divides a whole into the natural parts and reunites the scattered parts into a natural or organized whole which defines the abstract essences or universal ideas of all things and connects them which pierces the veil of hypotheses and reaches the final cause or first principle of all which regards the sciences in relation to the idea of good
this ideal science is the highest process of thought and may be described as the soul conversing with herself or holding communion with eternal truth and beauty and in another form is the everlasting question and answer the ceaseless interrogative of socrates
the dialogues of plato are themselves examples of the nature and method of dialectic
viewed objectively the idea of good is a power or cause which makes the world without us correspond with the world within
yet this world without us is still a world of ideas
with plato the investigation of nature is another department of knowledge and in this he seeks to attain only probable conclusions 
if we ask whether this science of dialectic which plato only half explains to us is more akin to logic or to metaphysics the answer is that in his mind the two sciences are not as yet distinguished any more than the subjective and objective aspects of the world and of man which german philosophy has revealed to us
nor has he determined whether his science of dialectic is at rest or in motion concerned with the contemplation of absolute being or with a process of development and evolution
modern metaphysics may be described as the science of abstractions or as the science of the evolution of thought modern logic when passing beyond the bounds of mere aristotelian forms may be defined as the science of method
the germ of both of them is contained in the platonic dialectic all metaphysicians have something in common with the ideas of plato all logicians have derived something from the method of plato
the nearest approach in modern philosophy to the universal science of plato is to be found in the hegelian succession of moments in the unity of the idea
plato and hegel alike seem to have conceived the world as the correlation of abstractions and not impossibly they would have understood one another better than any of their commentators understand them 
there is however a difference between them for whereas hegel is thinking of all the minds of men as one mind which developes the stages of the idea in different countries or at different times in the same country with plato these gradations are regarded only as an order of thought or ideas the history of the human mind had not yet dawned upon him
many criticisms may be made on plato s theory of education
while in some respects he unavoidably falls short of modern thinkers in others he is in advance of them
he is opposed to the modes of education which prevailed in his own time but he can hardly be said to have discovered new ones
he does not see that education is relative to the characters of individuals he only desires to impress the same form of the state on the minds of all
he has no sufficient idea of the effect of literature on the formation of the mind and greatly exaggerates that of mathematics
his aim is above all things to train the reasoning faculties to implant in the mind the spirit and power of abstraction to explain and define general notions and if possible to connect them
no wonder that in the vacancy of actual knowledge his followers and at times even he himself should have fallen away from the doctrine of ideas and have returned to that branch of knowledge in which alone the relation of the one and many can be truly seen the science of number
in his views both of teaching and training he might be styled in modern language a doctrinaire after the spartan fashion he would have his citizens cast in one mould he does not seem to consider that some degree of freedom a little wholesome neglect is necessary to strengthen and develope the character and to give play to the individual nature
his citizens would not have acquired that knowledge which in the vision of er is supposed to be gained by the pilgrims from their experience of evil
on the other hand plato is far in advance of modern philosophers and theologians when he teaches that education is to be continued through life and will begin again in another
he would never allow education of some kind to cease although he was aware that the proverbial saying of solon i grow old learning many things cannot be applied literally
himself ravished with the contemplation of the idea of good and delighting in solid geometry he has no difficulty in imagining that a lifetime might be passed happily in such pursuits
we who know how many more men of business there are in the world than real students or thinkers are not equally sanguine
the education which he proposes for his citizens is really the ideal life of the philosopher or man of genius interrupted but only for a time by practical duties a life not for the many but for the few
yet the thought of plato may not be wholly incapable of application to our own times
even if regarded as an ideal which can never be realized it may have a great effect in elevating the characters of mankind and raising them above the routine of their ordinary occupation or profession
it is the best form under which we can conceive the whole of life
nevertheless the idea of plato is not easily put into practice
for the education of after life is necessarily the education which each one gives himself
men and women cannot be brought together in schools or colleges at forty or fifty years of age and if they could the result would be disappointing
the destination of most men is what plato would call the den for the whole of life and with that they are content
neither have they teachers or advisers with whom they can take counsel in riper years
there is no schoolmaster abroad who will tell them of their faults or inspire them with the higher sense of duty or with the ambition of a true success in life no socrates who will convict them of ignorance no christ or follower of christ who will reprove them of sin
hence they have a difficulty in receiving the first element of improvement which is self knowledge
the hopes of youth no longer stir them they rather wish to rest than to pursue high objects
a few only who have come across great men and women or eminent teachers of religion and morality have received a second life from them and have lighted a candle from the fire of their genius
the want of energy is one of the main reasons why so few persons continue to improve in later years
they have not the will and do not know the way
they never try an experiment or look up a point of interest for themselves they make no sacrifices for the sake of knowledge their minds like their bodies at a certain age become fixed
genius has been defined as the power of taking pains but hardly any one keeps up his interest in knowledge throughout a whole life
the troubles of a family the business of making money the demands of a profession destroy the elasticity of the mind
the waxen tablet of the memory which was once capable of receiving true thoughts and clear impressions becomes hard and crowded there is not room for the accumulations of a long life 
the student as years advance rather makes an exchange of knowledge than adds to his stores
there is no pressing necessity to learn the stock of classics or history or natural science which was enough for a man at twenty five is enough for him at fifty
neither is it easy to give a definite answer to any one who asks how he is to improve
for self education consists in a thousand things commonplace in themselves in adding to what we are by nature something of what we are not in learning to see ourselves as others see us in judging not by opinion but by the evidence of facts in seeking out the society of superior minds in a study of lives and writings of great men in observation of the world and character in receiving kindly the natural influence of different times of life in any act or thought which is raised above the practice or opinions of mankind in the pursuit of some new or original enquiry in any effort of mind which calls forth some latent power
if any one is desirous of carrying out in detail the platonic education of after life some such counsels as the following may be offered to him that he shall choose the branch of knowledge to which his own mind most distinctly inclines and in which he takes the greatest delight either one which seems to connect with his own daily employment or perhaps furnishes the greatest contrast to it
he may study from the speculative side the profession or business in which he is practically engaged
he may make homer dante shakespeare plato bacon the friends and companions of his life
he may find opportunities of hearing the living voice of a great teacher
he may select for enquiry some point of history or some unexplained phenomenon of nature
an hour a day passed in such scientific or literary pursuits will furnish as many facts as the memory can retain and will give him a pleasure not to be repented of 
only let him beware of being the slave of crotchets or of running after a will o the wisp in his ignorance or in his vanity of attributing to himself the gifts of a poet or assuming the air of a philosopher
he should know the limits of his own powers
better to build up the mind by slow additions to creep on quietly from one thing to another to gain insensibly new powers and new interests in knowledge than to form vast schemes which are never destined to be realized
but perhaps as plato would say this is part of another subject though we may also defend our digression by his example

we remark with surprise that the progress of nations or the natural growth of institutions which fill modern treatises on political philosophy seem hardly ever to have attracted the attention of plato and aristotle
the ancients were familiar with the mutability of human affairs they could moralize over the ruins of cities and the fall of empires by them fate and chance were deemed to be real powers almost persons and to have had a great share in political events
the wiser of them like thucydides believed that what had been would be again and that a tolerable idea of the future could be gathered from the past
also they had dreams of a golden age which existed once upon a time and might still exist in some unknown land or might return again in the remote future
but the regular growth of a state enlightened by experience progressing in knowledge improving in the arts of which the citizens were educated by the fulfilment of political duties appears never to have come within the range of their hopes and aspirations
such a state had never been seen and therefore could not be conceived by them
their experience led them to conclude that there had been cycles of civilization in which the arts had been discovered and lost many times over and cities had been overthrown and rebuilt again and again and deluges and volcanoes and other natural convulsions had altered the face of the earth
tradition told them of many destructions of mankind and of the preservation of a remnant
the world began again after a deluge and was reconstructed out of the fragments of itself
also they were acquainted with empires of unknown antiquity like the egyptian or assyrian but they had never seen them grow and could not imagine any more than we can the state of man which preceded them
they were puzzled and awestricken by the egyptian monuments of which the forms as plato says not in a figure but literally were ten thousand years old and they contrasted the antiquity of egypt with their own short memories
the early legends of hellas have no real connection with the later history they are at a distance and the intermediate region is concealed from view there is no road or path which leads from one to the other
at the beginning of greek history in the vestibule of the temple is seen standing first of all the figure of the legislator himself the interpreter and servant of the god
the fundamental laws which he gives are not supposed to change with time and circumstances
the salvation of the state is held rather to depend on the inviolable maintenance of them
they were sanctioned by the authority of heaven and it was deemed impiety to alter them
the desire to maintain them unaltered seems to be the origin of what at first sight is very surprising to us the intolerant zeal of plato against innovators in religion or politics although with a happy inconsistency he is also willing that the laws of other countries should be studied and improvements in legislation privately communicated to the nocturnal council 
the additions which were made to them in later ages in order to meet the increasing complexity of affairs were still ascribed by a fiction to the original legislator and the words of such enactments at athens were disputed over as if they had been the words of solon himself
plato hopes to preserve in a later generation the mind of the legislator he would have his citizens remain within the lines which he has laid down for them
he would not harass them with minute regulations he would have allowed some changes in the laws but not changes which would affect the fundamental institutions of the state such for example as would convert an aristocracy into a timocracy or a timocracy into a popular form of government
passing from speculations to facts we observe that progress has been the exception rather than the law of human history
and therefore we are not surprised to find that the idea of progress is of modern rather than of ancient date and like the idea of a philosophy of history is not more than a century or two old
it seems to have arisen out of the impression left on the human mind by the growth of the roman empire and of the christian church and to be due to the political and social improvements which they introduced into the world and still more in our own century to the idealism of the first french revolution and the triumph of american independence and in a yet greater degree to the vast material prosperity and growth of population in england and her colonies and in america
it is also to be ascribed in a measure to the greater study of the philosophy of history
the optimist temperament of some great writers has assisted the creation of it while the opposite character has led a few to regard the future of the world as dark
the spectator of all time and of all existence sees more of the increasing purpose which through the ages ran than formerly but to the inhabitant of a small state of hellas the vision was necessarily limited like the valley in which he dwelt
there was no remote past on which his eye could rest nor any future from which the veil was partly lifted up by the analogy of history
the narrowness of view which to ourselves appears so singular was to him natural if not unavoidable

for the relation of the republic to the statesman and the laws and the two other works of plato which directly treat of politics see the introductions to the two latter a few general points of comparison may be touched upon in this place
and first of the laws
the republic though probably written at intervals yet speaking generally and judging by the indications of thought and style may be reasonably ascribed to the middle period of plato s life the laws are certainly the work of his declining years and some portions of them at any rate seem to have been written in extreme old age
the republic is full of hope and aspiration the laws bear the stamp of failure and disappointment
the one is a finished work which received the last touches of the author the other is imperfectly executed and apparently unfinished
the one has the grace and beauty of youth the other has lost the poetical form but has more of the severity and knowledge of life which is characteristic of old age
the most conspicuous defect of the laws is the failure of dramatic power whereas the republic is full of striking contrasts of ideas and oppositions of character
the laws may be said to have more the nature of a sermon the republic of a poem the one is more religious the other more intellectual
many theories of plato such as the doctrine of ideas the government of the world by philosophers are not found in the laws the immortality of the soul is first mentioned in xii the person of socrates has altogether disappeared
the community of women and children is renounced the institution of common or public meals for women is for the first time introduced 
there remains in the laws the old enmity to the poets who are ironically saluted in high flown terms and at the same time are peremptorily ordered out of the city if they are not willing to submit their poems to the censorship of the magistrates 
though the work is in most respects inferior there are a few passages in the laws such as the honour due to the soul the evils of licentious or unnatural love the whole of book x
the dishonesty of retail trade and bequests which come more home to us and contain more of what may be termed the modern element in plato than almost anything in the republic
the relation of the two works to one another is very well given by aristotle in the politics from the side of the laws the same or nearly the same objections apply to plato s later work the laws and therefore we had better examine briefly the constitution which is therein described
in the republic socrates has definitely settled in all a few questions only such as the community of women and children the community of property and the constitution of the state
the population is divided into two classes one of husbandmen and the other of warriors from this latter is taken a third class of counsellors and rulers of the state
but socrates has not determined whether the husbandmen and artists are to have a share in the government and whether they too are to carry arms and share in military service or not
he certainly thinks that the women ought to share in the education of the guardians and to fight by their side
the remainder of the work is filled up with digressions foreign to the main subject and with discussions about the education of the guardians
in the laws there is hardly anything but laws not much is said about the constitution
this which he had intended to make more of the ordinary type he gradually brings round to the other or ideal form
for with the exception of the community of women and property he supposes everything to be the same in both states there is to be the same education the citizens of both are to live free from servile occupations and there are to be common meals in both
the only difference is that in the laws the common meals are extended to women and the warriors number about 5000 but in the republic only 1000
by plato in the laws from the side of the republic the first and highest form of the state and of the government and of the law is that in which there prevails most widely the ancient saying that friends have all things in common
whether there is now or ever will be this communion of women and children and of property in which the private and individual is altogether banished from life and things which are by nature private such as eyes and ears and hands have become common and all men express praise and blame and feel joy and sorrow on the same occasions and the laws unite the city to the utmost whether all this is possible or not i say that no man acting upon any other principle will ever constitute a state more exalted in virtue or truer or better than this
such a state whether inhabited by gods or sons of gods will make them blessed who dwell therein and therefore to this we are to look for the pattern of the state and to cling to this and as far as possible to seek for one which is like this
the state which we have now in hand when created will be nearest to immortality and unity in the next degree and after that by the grace of god we will complete the third one
and we will begin by speaking of the nature and origin of the second
the comparatively short work called the statesman or politicus in its style and manner is more akin to the laws while in its idealism it rather resembles the republic
as far as we can judge by various indications of language and thought it must be later than the one and of course earlier than the other
in both the republic and statesman a close connection is maintained between politics and dialectic
in the statesman enquiries into the principles of method are interspersed with discussions about politics
the comparative advantages of the rule of law and of a person are considered and the decision given in favour of a person 
but much may be said on the other side nor is the opposition necessary for a person may rule by law and law may be so applied as to be the living voice of the legislator
as in the republic there is a myth describing however not a future but a former existence of mankind
the question is asked whether the state of innocence which is described in the myth or a state like our own which possesses art and science and distinguishes good from evil is the preferable condition of man
to this question of the comparative happiness of civilized and primitive life which was so often discussed in the last century and in our own no answer is given
the statesman though less perfect in style than the republic and of far less range may justly be regarded as one of the greatest of plato s dialogues
6
others as well as plato have chosen an ideal republic to be the vehicle of thoughts which they could not definitely express or which went beyond their own age
the classical writing which approaches most nearly to the republic of plato is the de republica of cicero but neither in this nor in any other of his dialogues does he rival the art of plato
the manners are clumsy and inferior the hand of the rhetorician is apparent at every turn
yet noble sentiments are constantly recurring the true note of roman patriotism we romans are a great people resounds through the whole work
like socrates cicero turns away from the phenomena of the heavens to civil and political life
he would rather not discuss the two suns of which all rome was talking when he can converse about the two nations in one which had divided rome ever since the days of the gracchi
like socrates again speaking in the person of scipio he is afraid lest he should assume too much the character of a teacher rather than of an equal who is discussing among friends the two sides of a question
he would confine the terms king or state to the rule of reason and justice and he will not concede that title either to a democracy or to a monarchy
but under the rule of reason and justice he is willing to include the natural superior ruling over the natural inferior which he compares to the soul ruling over the body
he prefers a mixture of forms of government to any single one
the two portraits of the just and the unjust which occur in the second book of the republic are transferred to the state philus one of the interlocutors maintaining against his will the necessity of injustice as a principle of government while the other laelius supports the opposite thesis
his views of language and number are derived from plato like him he denounces the drama
he also declares that if his life were to be twice as long he would have no time to read the lyric poets
the picture of democracy is translated by him word for word though he had hardly shown himself able to carry the jest of plato
he converts into a stately sentence the humorous fancy about the animals who are so imbued with the spirit of democracy that they make the passers by get out of their way
his description of the tyrant is imitated from plato but is far inferior
the second book is historical and claims for the roman constitution a foundation of fact such as plato probably intended to have given to the republic in the critias
his most remarkable imitation of plato is the adaptation of the vision of er which is converted by cicero into the somnium scipionis he has romanized the myth of the republic adding an argument for the immortality of the soul taken from the phaedrus and some other touches derived from the phaedo and the timaeus
though a beautiful tale and containing splendid passages the somnium scipionis is very inferior to the vision of er it is only a dream and hardly allows the reader to suppose that the writer believes in his own creation
whether his dialogues were framed on the model of the lost dialogues of aristotle as he himself tells us or of plato to which they bear many superficial resemblances he is still the roman orator he is not conversing but making speeches and is never able to mould the intractable latin to the grace and ease of the greek platonic dialogue
but if he is defective in form much more is he inferior to the greek in matter he nowhere in his philosophical writings leaves upon our minds the impression of an original thinker
plato s republic has been said to be a church and not a state and such an ideal of a city in the heavens has always hovered over the christian world and is embodied in st
augustine s de civitate dei which is suggested by the decay and fall of the roman empire much in the same manner in which we may imagine the republic of plato to have been influenced by the decline of greek politics in the writer s own age
the difference is that in the time of plato the degeneracy though certain was gradual and insensible whereas the taking of rome by the goths stirred like an earthquake the age of st
augustine
men were inclined to believe that the overthrow of the city was to be ascribed to the anger felt by the old roman deities at the neglect of their worship
st
augustine maintains the opposite thesis he argues that the destruction of the roman empire is due not to the rise of christianity but to the vices of paganism
he wanders over roman history and over greek philosophy and mythology and finds everywhere crime impiety and falsehood
he compares the worst parts of the gentile religions with the best elements of the faith of christ
he shows nothing of the spirit which led others of the early christian fathers to recognize in the writings of the greek philosophers the power of the divine truth
he traces the parallel of the kingdom of god that is the history of the jews contained in their scriptures and of the kingdoms of the world which are found in gentile writers and pursues them both into an ideal future
it need hardly be remarked that his use both of greek and of roman historians and of the sacred writings of the jews is wholly uncritical
the heathen mythology the sybilline oracles the myths of plato the dreams of neo platonists are equally regarded by him as matter of fact
he must be acknowledged to be a strictly polemical or controversial writer who makes the best of everything on one side and the worst of everything on the other
he has no sympathy with the old roman life as plato has with greek life nor has he any idea of the ecclesiastical kingdom which was to arise out of the ruins of the roman empire
he is not blind to the defects of the christian church and looks forward to a time when christian and pagan shall be alike brought before the judgment seat and the true city of god shall appear.the work of st
augustine is a curious repertory of antiquarian learning and quotations deeply penetrated with christian ethics but showing little power of reasoning and a slender knowledge of the greek literature and language
he was a great genius and a noble character yet hardly capable of feeling or understanding anything external to his own theology
of all the ancient philosophers he is most attracted by plato though he is very slightly acquainted with his writings
he is inclined to believe that the idea of creation in the timaeus is derived from the narrative in genesis and he is strangely taken with the coincidence of plato s saying that the philosopher is the lover of god and the words of the book of exodus in which god reveals himself to moses he dwells at length on miracles performed in his own day of which the evidence is regarded by him as irresistible
he speaks in a very interesting manner of the beauty and utility of nature and of the human frame which he conceives to afford a foretaste of the heavenly state and of the resurrection of the body
the book is not really what to most persons the title of it would imply and belongs to an age which has passed away
but it contains many fine passages and thoughts which are for all time
the short treatise de monarchia of dante is by far the most remarkable of mediaeval ideals and bears the impress of the great genius in whom italy and the middle ages are so vividly reflected
it is the vision of an universal empire which is supposed to be the natural and necessary government of the world having a divine authority distinct from the papacy yet coextensive with it
it is not the ghost of the dead roman empire sitting crowned upon the grave thereof but the legitimate heir and successor of it justified by the ancient virtues of the romans and the beneficence of their rule
their right to be the governors of the world is also confirmed by the testimony of miracles and acknowledged by st
paul when he appealed to caesar and even more emphatically by christ himself who could not have made atonement for the sins of men if he had not been condemned by a divinely authorized tribunal
the necessity for the establishment of an universal empire is proved partly by a priori arguments such as the unity of god and the unity of the family or nation partly by perversions of scripture and history by false analogies of nature by misapplied quotations from the classics and by odd scraps and commonplaces of logic showing a familiar but by no means exact knowledge of aristotle 
but a more convincing argument still is the miserable state of the world which he touchingly describes
he sees no hope of happiness or peace for mankind until all nations of the earth are comprehended in a single empire
the whole treatise shows how deeply the idea of the roman empire was fixed in the minds of his contemporaries
not much argument was needed to maintain the truth of a theory which to his own contemporaries seemed so natural and congenial
he speaks or rather preaches from the point of view not of the ecclesiastic but of the layman although as a good catholic he is willing to acknowledge that in certain respects the empire must submit to the church
the beginning and end of all his noble reflections and of his arguments good and bad is the aspiration that in this little plot of earth belonging to mortal man life may pass in freedom and peace
so inextricably is his vision of the future bound up with the beliefs and circumstances of his own age
the utopia of sir thomas more is a surprising monument of his genius and shows a reach of thought far beyond his contemporaries
the book was written by him at the age of about 34 or 35 and is full of the generous sentiments of youth
he brings the light of plato to bear upon the miserable state of his own country
living not long after the wars of the roses and in the dregs of the catholic church in england he is indignant at the corruption of the clergy at the luxury of the nobility and gentry at the sufferings of the poor at the calamities caused by war
to the eye of more the whole world was in dissolution and decay and side by side with the misery and oppression which he has described in the first book of the utopia he places in the second book the ideal state which by the help of plato he had constructed
the times were full of stir and intellectual interest
the distant murmur of the reformation was beginning to be heard
to minds like more s greek literature was a revelation there had arisen an art of interpretation and the new testament was beginning to be understood as it had never been before and has not often been since in its natural sense
the life there depicted appeared to him wholly unlike that of christian commonwealths in which he saw nothing but a certain conspiracy of rich men procuring their own commodities under the name and title of the commonwealth
he thought that christ like plato instituted all things common for which reason he tells us the citizens of utopia were the more willing to receive his doctrines 

the community of property is a fixed idea with him though he is aware of the arguments which may be urged on the other side when i consider with myself i hold well with plato and do nothing marvel that he would make no laws for them that refused those laws whereby all men should have and enjoy equal portions of riches and commodities
for the wise men did easily foresee this to be the one and only way to the wealth of a community if equality of all things should be brought in and established 

we wonder how in the reign of henry viii though veiled in another language and published in a foreign country such speculations could have been endured
he is gifted with far greater dramatic invention than any one who succeeded him with the exception of swift
in the art of feigning he is a worthy disciple of plato
like him starting from a small portion of fact he founds his tale with admirable skill on a few lines in the latin narrative of the voyages of amerigo vespucci
he is very precise about dates and facts and has the power of making us believe that the narrator of the tale must have been an eyewitness
we are fairly puzzled by his manner of mixing up real and imaginary persons his boy john clement and peter giles citizen of antwerp with whom he disputes about the precise words which are supposed to have been used by the portuguese traveller raphael hythloday
i have the more cause says hythloday to fear that my words shall not be believed for that i know how difficultly and hardly i myself would have believed another man telling the same if i had not myself seen it with mine own eyes
or again if you had been with me in utopia and had presently seen their fashions and laws as i did which lived there five years and more and would never have come thence but only to make the new land known here etc
more greatly regrets that he forgot to ask hythloday in what part of the world utopia is situated he would have spent no small sum of money rather than it should have escaped him and he begs peter giles to see hythloday or write to him and obtain an answer to the question
after this we are not surprised to hear that a professor of divinity is desirous of being sent thither as a missionary by the high bishop yea and that he may himself be made bishop of utopia nothing doubting that he must obtain this bishopric with suit and he counteth that a godly suit which proceedeth not of the desire of honour or lucre but only of a godly zeal
the design may have failed through the disappearance of hythloday concerning whom we have very uncertain news after his departure
there is no doubt however that he had told more and giles the exact situation of the island but unfortunately at the same moment more s attention as he is reminded in a letter from giles was drawn off by a servant and one of the company from a cold caught on shipboard coughed so loud as to prevent giles from hearing
and the secret has perished with him to this day the place of utopia remains unknown
the words of phaedrus o socrates you can easily invent egyptians or anything are recalled to our mind as we read this lifelike fiction
yet the greater merit of the work is not the admirable art but the originality of thought
more is as free as plato from the prejudices of his age and far more tolerant
the utopians do not allow him who believes not in the immortality of the soul to share in the administration of the state howbeit they put him to no punishment because they be persuaded that it is in no man s power to believe what he list and no man is to be blamed for reasoning in support of his own religion 
in the public services no prayers be used but such as every man may boldly pronounce without giving offence to any sect
he says significantly there be that give worship to a man that was once of excellent virtue or of famous glory not only as god but also the chiefest and highest god
but the most and the wisest part rejecting all these believe that there is a certain godly power unknown far above the capacity and reach of man s wit dispersed throughout all the world not in bigness but in virtue and power
him they call the father of all
to him alone they attribute the beginnings the increasings the proceedings the changes and the ends of all things
neither give they any divine honours to any other than him
so far was more from sharing the popular beliefs of his time
yet at the end he reminds us that he does not in all respects agree with the customs and opinions of the utopians which he describes
and we should let him have the benefit of this saving clause and not rudely withdraw the veil behind which he has been pleased to conceal himself
nor is he less in advance of popular opinion in his political and moral speculations
he would like to bring military glory into contempt he would set all sorts of idle people to profitable occupation including in the same class priests women noblemen gentlemen and sturdy and valiant beggars that the labour of all may be reduced to six hours a day
his dislike of capital punishment and plans for the reformation of offenders his detestation of priests and lawyers have priests of exceeding holiness and therefore very few
his remark that although every one may hear of ravenous dogs and wolves and cruel man eaters it is not easy to find states that are well and wisely governed are curiously at variance with the notions of his age and indeed with his own life
there are many points in which he shows a modern feeling and a prophetic insight like plato
he is a sanitary reformer he maintains that civilized states have a right to the soil of waste countries he is inclined to the opinion which places happiness in virtuous pleasures but herein as he thinks not disagreeing from those other philosophers who define virtue to be a life according to nature
he extends the idea of happiness so as to include the happiness of others and he argues ingeniously all men agree that we ought to make others happy but if others how much more ourselves
and still he thinks that there may be a more excellent way but to this no man s reason can attain unless heaven should inspire him with a higher truth
his ceremonies before marriage his humane proposal that war should be carried on by assassinating the leaders of the enemy may be compared to some of the paradoxes of plato
he has a charming fancy like the affinities of greeks and barbarians in the timaeus that the utopians learnt the language of the greeks with the more readiness because they were originally of the same race with them
he is penetrated with the spirit of plato and quotes or adapts many thoughts both from the republic and from the timaeus
he prefers public duties to private and is somewhat impatient of the importunity of relations
his citizens have no silver or gold of their own but are ready enough to pay them to their mercenaries
there is nothing of which he is more contemptuous than the love of money
gold is used for fetters of criminals and diamonds and pearls for children s necklaces like plato he is full of satirical reflections on governments and princes on the state of the world and of knowledge
the hero of his discourse is very unwilling to become a minister of state considering that he would lose his independence and his advice would never be heeded he ridicules the new logic of his time the utopians could never be made to understand the doctrine of second intentions bigger than was ever any giant yea and pointed to of us even with our finger
he is very severe on the sports of the gentry the utopians count hunting the lowest the vilest and the most abject part of butchery
he quotes the words of the republic in which the philosopher is described standing out of the way under a wall until the driving storm of sleet and rain be overpast which admit of a singular application to more s own fate although writing twenty years before he can hardly be supposed to have foreseen this
there is no touch of satire which strikes deeper than his quiet remark that the greater part of the precepts of christ are more at variance with the lives of ordinary christians than the discourse of utopia because they saw men evil willing to frame their manners to christ s rule they have wrested and wried his doctrine and like a rule of lead have applied it to men s manners that by some means at the least way they might agree together
the new atlantis is only a fragment and far inferior in merit to the utopia
the work is full of ingenuity but wanting in creative fancy and by no means impresses the reader with a sense of credibility
in some places lord bacon is characteristically different from sir thomas more as for example in the external state which he attributes to the governor of solomon s house whose dress he minutely describes while to sir thomas more such trappings appear simple ridiculous
yet after this programme of dress bacon adds the beautiful trait that he had a look as though he pitied men
several things are borrowed by him from the timaeus but he has injured the unity of style by adding thoughts and passages which are taken from the hebrew scriptures
the city of the sun written by campanella a dominican friar several years after the new atlantis of bacon has many resemblances to the republic of plato
the citizens have wives and children in common their marriages are of the same temporary sort and are arranged by the magistrates from time to time
they do not however adopt his system of lots but bring together the best natures male and female according to philosophical rules
the infants until two years of age are brought up by their mothers in public temples and since individuals for the most part educate their children badly at the beginning of their third year they are committed to the care of the state and are taught at first not out of books but from paintings of all kinds which are emblazoned on the walls of the city
the city has six interior circuits of walls and an outer wall which is the seventh
on this outer wall are painted the figures of legislators and philosophers and on each of the interior walls the symbols or forms of some one of the sciences are delineated
the women are for the most part trained like the men in warlike and other exercises but they have two special occupations of their own
after a battle they and the boys soothe and relieve the wounded warriors also they encourage them with embraces and pleasant words
some elements of the christian or catholic religion are preserved among them
the life of the apostles is greatly admired by this people because they had all things in common and the short prayer which jesus christ taught men is used in their worship
it is a duty of the chief magistrates to pardon sins and therefore the whole people make secret confession of them to the magistrates and they to their chief who is a sort of rector metaphysicus and by this means he is well informed of all that is going on in the minds of men
after confession absolution is granted to the citizens collectively but no one is mentioned by name
there also exists among them a practice of perpetual prayer performed by a succession of priests who change every hour
their religion is a worship of god in trinity that is of wisdom love and power but without any distinction of persons
they behold in the sun the reflection of his glory mere graven images they reject refusing to fall under the tyranny of idolatry
many details are given about their customs of eating and drinking about their mode of dressing their employments their wars
campanella looks forward to a new mode of education which is to be a study of nature and not of aristotle
he would not have his citizens waste their time in the consideration of what he calls the dead signs of things
he remarks that he who knows one science only does not really know that one any more than the rest and insists strongly on the necessity of a variety of knowledge
more scholars are turned out in the city of the sun in one year than by contemporary methods in ten or fifteen
he evidently believes like bacon that henceforward natural science will play a great part in education a hope which seems hardly to have been realized either in our own or in any former age at any rate the fulfilment of it has been long deferred
there is a good deal of ingenuity and even originality in this work and a most enlightened spirit pervades it
but it has little or no charm of style and falls very far short of the new atlantis of bacon and still more of the utopia of sir thomas more
it is full of inconsistencies and though borrowed from plato shows but a superficial acquaintance with his writings
it is a work such as one might expect to have been written by a philosopher and man of genius who was also a friar and who had spent twenty seven years of his life in a prison of the inquisition
the most interesting feature of the book common to plato and sir thomas more is the deep feeling which is shown by the writer of the misery and ignorance prevailing among the lower classes in his own time
campanella takes note of aristotle s answer to plato s community of property that in a society where all things are common no individual would have any motive to work he replies that his citizens being happy and contented in themselves will have greater regard for their fellows than exists among men at present
he thinks like plato that if he abolishes private feelings and interests a great public feeling will take their place
other writings on ideal states such as the oceana of harrington in which the lord archon meaning cromwell is described not as he was but as he ought to have been or the argenis of barclay which is an historical allegory of his own time are too unlike plato to be worth mentioning
more interesting than either of these and far more platonic in style and thought is sir john eliot s monarchy of man in which the prisoner of the tower no longer able to be a politician in the land of his birth turns away from politics to view that other city which is within him and finds on the very threshold of the grave that the secret of human happiness is the mastery of self
the change of government in the time of the english commonwealth set men thinking about first principles and gave rise to many works of this class.the great original genius of swift owes nothing to plato nor is there any trace in the conversation or in the works of dr
johnson of any acquaintance with his writings
he probably would have refuted plato without reading him in the same fashion in which he supposed himself to have refuted bishop berkeley s theory of the non existence of matter
if we except the so called english platonists or rather neo platonists who never understood their master and the writings of coleridge who was to some extent a kindred spirit plato has left no permanent impression on english literature

human life and conduct are affected by ideals in the same way that they are affected by the examples of eminent men
neither the one nor the other are immediately applicable to practice but there is a virtue flowing from them which tends to raise individuals above the common routine of society or trade and to elevate states above the mere interests of commerce or the necessities of self defence
like the ideals of art they are partly framed by the omission of particulars they require to be viewed at a certain distance and are apt to fade away if we attempt to approach them
they gain an imaginary distinctness when embodied in a state or in a system of philosophy but they still remain the visions of a world unrealized
more striking and obvious to the ordinary mind are the examples of great men who have served their own generation and are remembered in another
even in our own family circle there may have been some one a woman or even a child in whose face has shone forth a goodness more than human
the ideal then approaches nearer to us and we fondly cling to it
the ideal of the past whether of our own past lives or of former states of society has a singular fascination for the minds of many
too late we learn that such ideals cannot be recalled though the recollection of them may have a humanizing influence on other times
but the abstractions of philosophy are to most persons cold and vacant they give light without warmth they are like the full moon in the heavens when there are no stars appearing
men cannot live by thought alone the world of sense is always breaking in upon them
they are for the most part confined to a corner of earth and see but a little way beyond their own home or place of abode they do not lift up their eyes to the hills they are not awake when the dawn appears
but in plato we have reached a height from which a man may look into the distance and behold the future of the world and of philosophy
the ideal of the state and of the life of the philosopher the ideal of an education continuing through life and extending equally to both sexes the ideal of the unity and correlation of knowledge the faith in good and immortality are the vacant forms of light on which plato is seeking to fix the eye of mankind

two other ideals which never appeared above the horizon in greek philosophy float before the minds of men in our own day one seen more clearly than formerly as though each year and each generation brought us nearer to some great change the other almost in the same degree retiring from view behind the laws of nature as if oppressed by them but still remaining a silent hope of we know not what hidden in the heart of man
the first ideal is the future of the human race in this world the second the future of the individual in another
the first is the more perfect realization of our own present life the second the abnegation of it the one limited by experience the other transcending it
both of them have been and are powerful motives of action there are a few in whom they have taken the place of all earthly interests
the hope of a future for the human race at first sight seems to be the more disinterested the hope of individual existence the more egotistical of the two motives
but when men have learned to resolve their hope of a future either for themselves or for the world into the will of god not my will but thine the difference between them falls away and they may be allowed to make either of them the basis of their lives according to their own individual character or temperament
there is as much faith in the willingness to work for an unseen future in this world as in another
neither is it inconceivable that some rare nature may feel his duty to another generation or to another century almost as strongly as to his own or that living always in the presence of god he may realize another world as vividly as he does this
the greatest of all ideals may or rather must be conceived by us under similitudes derived from human qualities although sometimes like the jewish prophets we may dash away these figures of speech and describe the nature of god only in negatives
these again by degrees acquire a positive meaning
it would be well if when meditating on the higher truths either of philosophy or religion we sometimes substituted one form of expression for another lest through the necessities of language we should become the slaves of mere words
there is a third ideal not the same but akin to these which has a place in the home and heart of every believer in the religion of christ and in which men seem to find a nearer and more familiar truth the divine man the son of man the saviour of mankind who is the first born and head of the whole family in heaven and earth in whom the divine and human that which is without and that which is within the range of our earthly faculties are indissolubly united
neither is this divine form of goodness wholly separable from the ideal of the christian church which is said in the new testament to be his body or at variance with those other images of good which plato sets before us
we see him in a figure only and of figures of speech we select but a few and those the simplest to be the expression of him
we behold him in a picture but he is not there
we gather up the fragments of his discourses but neither do they represent him as he truly was
his dwelling is neither in heaven nor earth but in the heart of man
this is that image which plato saw dimly in the distance which when existing among men he called in the language of homer the likeness of god the likeness of a nature which in all ages men have felt to be greater and better than themselves and which in endless forms whether derived from scripture or nature from the witness of history or from the human heart regarded as a person or not as a person with or without parts or passions existing in space or not in space is and will always continue to be to mankind the idea of good
the republic
persons of the dialogue
socrates who is the narrator
glaucon
adeimantus
polemarchus
cephalus
thrasymachus
cleitophon
and others who are mute auditors
the scene is laid in the house of cephalus at the piraeus and the whole dialogue is narrated by socrates the day after it actually took place to timaeus hermocrates critias and a nameless person who are introduced in the timaeus
book i
i went down yesterday to the piraeus with glaucon the son of ariston that i might offer up my prayers to the goddess and also because i wanted to see in what manner they would celebrate the festival which was a new thing
i was delighted with the procession of the inhabitants but that of the thracians was equally if not more beautiful
when we had finished our prayers and viewed the spectacle we turned in the direction of the city and at that instant polemarchus the son of cephalus chanced to catch sight of us from a distance as we were starting on our way home and told his servant to run and bid us wait for him
the servant took hold of me by the cloak behind and said polemarchus desires you to wait
i turned round and asked him where his master was
there he is said the youth coming after you if you will only wait
certainly we will said glaucon and in a few minutes polemarchus appeared and with him adeimantus glaucon s brother niceratus the son of nicias and several others who had been at the procession
polemarchus said to me i perceive socrates that you and your companion are already on your way to the city
you are not far wrong i said
but do you see he rejoined how many we are
of course
and are you stronger than all these
for if not you will have to remain where you are
may there not be the alternative i said that we may persuade you to let us go
but can you persuade us if we refuse to listen to you
he said
certainly not replied glaucon
then we are not going to listen of that you may be assured
adeimantus added has no one told you of the torch race on horseback in honour of the goddess which will take place in the evening
with horses
i replied that is a novelty
will horsemen carry torches and pass them one to another during the race
yes said polemarchus and not only so but a festival will be celebrated at night which you certainly ought to see
let us rise soon after supper and see this festival there will be a gathering of young men and we will have a good talk
stay then and do not be perverse
glaucon said i suppose since you insist that we must
very good i replied
accordingly we went with polemarchus to his house and there we found his brothers lysias and euthydemus and with them thrasymachus the chalcedonian charmantides the paeanian and cleitophon the son of aristonymus
there too was cephalus the father of polemarchus whom i had not seen for a long time and i thought him very much aged
he was seated on a cushioned chair and had a garland on his head for he had been sacrificing in the court and there were some other chairs in the room arranged in a semicircle upon which we sat down by him
he saluted me eagerly and then he said you don t come to see me socrates as often as you ought if i were still able to go and see you i would not ask you to come to me
but at my age i can hardly get to the city and therefore you should come oftener to the piraeus
for let me tell you that the more the pleasures of the body fade away the greater to me is the pleasure and charm of conversation
do not then deny my request but make our house your resort and keep company with these young men we are old friends and you will be quite at home with us
i replied there is nothing which for my part i like better cephalus than conversing with aged men for i regard them as travellers who have gone a journey which i too may have to go and of whom i ought to enquire whether the way is smooth and easy or rugged and difficult
and this is a question which i should like to ask of you who have arrived at that time which the poets call the threshold of old age is life harder towards the end or what report do you give of it
i will tell you socrates he said what my own feeling is
men of my age flock together we are birds of a feather as the old proverb says and at our meetings the tale of my acquaintance commonly is i cannot eat i cannot drink the pleasures of youth and love are fled away there was a good time once but now that is gone and life is no longer life
some complain of the slights which are put upon them by relations and they will tell you sadly of how many evils their old age is the cause
but to me socrates these complainers seem to blame that which is not really in fault
for if old age were the cause i too being old and every other old man would have felt as they do
but this is not my own experience nor that of others whom i have known
how well i remember the aged poet sophocles when in answer to the question how does love suit with age sophocles are you still the man you were
peace he replied most gladly have i escaped the thing of which you speak i feel as if i had escaped from a mad and furious master
his words have often occurred to my mind since and they seem as good to me now as at the time when he uttered them
for certainly old age has a great sense of calm and freedom when the passions relax their hold then as sophocles says we are freed from the grasp not of one mad master only but of many
the truth is socrates that these regrets and also the complaints about relations are to be attributed to the same cause which is not old age but men s characters and tempers for he who is of a calm and happy nature will hardly feel the pressure of age but to him who is of an opposite disposition youth and age are equally a burden
i listened in admiration and wanting to draw him out that he might go on yes cephalus i said but i rather suspect that people in general are not convinced by you when you speak thus they think that old age sits lightly upon you not because of your happy disposition but because you are rich and wealth is well known to be a great comforter
you are right he replied they are not convinced and there is something in what they say not however so much as they imagine
i might answer them as themistocles answered the seriphian who was abusing him and saying that he was famous not for his own merits but because he was an athenian if you had been a native of my country or i of yours neither of us would have been famous
and to those who are not rich and are impatient of old age the same reply may be made for to the good poor man old age cannot be a light burden nor can a bad rich man ever have peace with himself
may i ask cephalus whether your fortune was for the most part inherited or acquired by you
acquired
socrates do you want to know how much i acquired
in the art of making money i have been midway between my father and grandfather for my grandfather whose name i bear doubled and trebled the value of his patrimony that which he inherited being much what i possess now but my father lysanias reduced the property below what it is at present and i shall be satisfied if i leave to these my sons not less but a little more than i received
that was why i asked you the question i replied because i see that you are indifferent about money which is a characteristic rather of those who have inherited their fortunes than of those who have acquired them the makers of fortunes have a second love of money as a creation of their own resembling the affection of authors for their own poems or of parents for their children besides that natural love of it for the sake of use and profit which is common to them and all men
and hence they are very bad company for they can talk about nothing but the praises of wealth
that is true he said
yes that is very true but may i ask another question
what do you consider to be the greatest blessing which you have reaped from your wealth
one he said of which i could not expect easily to convince others
for let me tell you socrates that when a man thinks himself to be near death fears and cares enter into his mind which he never had before the tales of a world below and the punishment which is exacted there of deeds done here were once a laughing matter to him but now he is tormented with the thought that they may be true either from the weakness of age or because he is now drawing nearer to that other place he has a clearer view of these things suspicions and alarms crowd thickly upon him and he begins to reflect and consider what wrongs he has done to others
and when he finds that the sum of his transgressions is great he will many a time like a child start up in his sleep for fear and he is filled with dark forebodings
but to him who is conscious of no sin sweet hope as pindar charmingly says is the kind nurse of his age hope he says cherishes the soul of him who lives in justice and holiness and is the nurse of his age and the companion of his journey hope which is mightiest to sway the restless soul of man
how admirable are his words
and the great blessing of riches i do not say to every man but to a good man is that he has had no occasion to deceive or to defraud others either intentionally or unintentionally and when he departs to the world below he is not in any apprehension about offerings due to the gods or debts which he owes to men
now to this peace of mind the possession of wealth greatly contributes and therefore i say that setting one thing against another of the many advantages which wealth has to give to a man of sense this is in my opinion the greatest
well said cephalus i replied but as concerning justice what is it
to speak the truth and to pay your debts no more than this
and even to this are there not exceptions
suppose that a friend when in his right mind has deposited arms with me and he asks for them when he is not in his right mind ought i to give them back to him
no one would say that i ought or that i should be right in doing so any more than they would say that i ought always to speak the truth to one who is in his condition
you are quite right he replied
but then i said speaking the truth and paying your debts is not a correct definition of justice
quite correct socrates if simonides is to be believed said polemarchus interposing
i fear said cephalus that i must go now for i have to look after the sacrifices and i hand over the argument to polemarchus and the company
is not polemarchus your heir
i said
to be sure he answered and went away laughing to the sacrifices
tell me then o thou heir of the argument what did simonides say and according to you truly say about justice
he said that the repayment of a debt is just and in saying so he appears to me to be right
i should be sorry to doubt the word of such a wise and inspired man but his meaning though probably clear to you is the reverse of clear to me
for he certainly does not mean as we were just now saying that i ought to return a deposit of arms or of anything else to one who asks for it when he is not in his right senses and yet a deposit cannot be denied to be a debt
true
then when the person who asks me is not in his right mind i am by no means to make the return
certainly not
when simonides said that the repayment of a debt was justice he did not mean to include that case
certainly not for he thinks that a friend ought always to do good to a friend and never evil
you mean that the return of a deposit of gold which is to the injury of the receiver if the two parties are friends is not the repayment of a debt that is what you would imagine him to say
yes
and are enemies also to receive what we owe to them
to be sure he said they are to receive what we owe them and an enemy as i take it owes to an enemy that which is due or proper to him that is to say evil
simonides then after the manner of poets would seem to have spoken darkly of the nature of justice for he really meant to say that justice is the giving to each man what is proper to him and this he termed a debt
that must have been his meaning he said
by heaven
i replied and if we asked him what due or proper thing is given by medicine and to whom what answer do you think that he would make to us
he would surely reply that medicine gives drugs and meat and drink to human bodies
and what due or proper thing is given by cookery and to what
seasoning to food
and what is that which justice gives and to whom
if socrates we are to be guided at all by the analogy of the preceding instances then justice is the art which gives good to friends and evil to enemies
that is his meaning then
i think so
and who is best able to do good to his friends and evil to his enemies in time of sickness
the physician
or when they are on a voyage amid the perils of the sea
the pilot
and in what sort of actions or with a view to what result is the just man most able to do harm to his enemy and good to his friend
in going to war against the one and in making alliances with the other
but when a man is well my dear polemarchus there is no need of a physician
no
and he who is not on a voyage has no need of a pilot
no
then in time of peace justice will be of no use
i am very far from thinking so
you think that justice may be of use in peace as well as in war
yes
like husbandry for the acquisition of corn
yes
or like shoemaking for the acquisition of shoes that is what you mean
yes
and what similar use or power of acquisition has justice in time of peace
in contracts socrates justice is of use
and by contracts you mean partnerships
exactly
but is the just man or the skilful player a more useful and better partner at a game of draughts
the skilful player
and in the laying of bricks and stones is the just man a more useful or better partner than the builder
quite the reverse
then in what sort of partnership is the just man a better partner than the harp player as in playing the harp the harp player is certainly a better partner than the just man
in a money partnership
yes polemarchus but surely not in the use of money for you do not want a just man to be your counsellor in the purchase or sale of a horse a man who is knowing about horses would be better for that would he not
certainly
and when you want to buy a ship the shipwright or the pilot would be better
true
then what is that joint use of silver or gold in which the just man is to be preferred
when you want a deposit to be kept safely
you mean when money is not wanted but allowed to lie
precisely
that is to say justice is useful when money is useless
that is the inference
and when you want to keep a pruning hook safe then justice is useful to the individual and to the state but when you want to use it then the art of the vine dresser
clearly
and when you want to keep a shield or a lyre and not to use them you would say that justice is useful but when you want to use them then the art of the soldier or of the musician
certainly
and so of all other things justice is useful when they are useless and useless when they are useful
that is the inference
then justice is not good for much
but let us consider this further point is not he who can best strike a blow in a boxing match or in any kind of fighting best able to ward off a blow
certainly
and he who is most skilful in preventing or escaping from a disease is best able to create one
true
and he is the best guard of a camp who is best able to steal a march upon the enemy
certainly
then he who is a good keeper of anything is also a good thief
that i suppose is to be inferred
then if the just man is good at keeping money he is good at stealing it
that is implied in the argument
then after all the just man has turned out to be a thief
and this is a lesson which i suspect you must have learnt out of homer for he speaking of autolycus the maternal grandfather of odysseus who is a favourite of his affirms that he was excellent above all men in theft and perjury
and so you and homer and simonides are agreed that justice is an art of theft to be practised however for the good of friends and for the harm of enemies that was what you were saying
no certainly not that though i do not now know what i did say but i still stand by the latter words
well there is another question by friends and enemies do we mean those who are so really or only in seeming
surely he said a man may be expected to love those whom he thinks good and to hate those whom he thinks evil
yes but do not persons often err about good and evil many who are not good seem to be so and conversely
that is true
then to them the good will be enemies and the evil will be their friends
true
and in that case they will be right in doing good to the evil and evil to the good
clearly
but the good are just and would not do an injustice
true
then according to your argument it is just to injure those who do no wrong
nay socrates the doctrine is immoral
then i suppose that we ought to do good to the just and harm to the unjust
i like that better
but see the consequence many a man who is ignorant of human nature has friends who are bad friends and in that case he ought to do harm to them and he has good enemies whom he ought to benefit but if so we shall be saying the very opposite of that which we affirmed to be the meaning of simonides
very true he said and i think that we had better correct an error into which we seem to have fallen in the use of the words friend and enemy
what was the error polemarchus
i asked
we assumed that he is a friend who seems to be or who is thought good
and how is the error to be corrected
we should rather say that he is a friend who is as well as seems good and that he who seems only and is not good only seems to be and is not a friend and of an enemy the same may be said
you would argue that the good are our friends and the bad our enemies
yes
and instead of saying simply as we did at first that it is just to do good to our friends and harm to our enemies we should further say it is just to do good to our friends when they are good and harm to our enemies when they are evil
yes that appears to me to be the truth
but ought the just to injure any one at all
undoubtedly he ought to injure those who are both wicked and his enemies
when horses are injured are they improved or deteriorated
the latter
deteriorated that is to say in the good qualities of horses not of dogs
yes of horses
and dogs are deteriorated in the good qualities of dogs and not of horses
of course
and will not men who are injured be deteriorated in that which is the proper virtue of man
certainly
and that human virtue is justice
to be sure
then men who are injured are of necessity made unjust
that is the result
but can the musician by his art make men unmusical
certainly not
or the horseman by his art make them bad horsemen
impossible
and can the just by justice make men unjust or speaking generally can the good by virtue make them bad
assuredly not
any more than heat can produce cold
it cannot
or drought moisture
clearly not
nor can the good harm any one
impossible
and the just is the good
certainly
then to injure a friend or any one else is not the act of a just man but of the opposite who is the unjust
i think that what you say is quite true socrates
then if a man says that justice consists in the repayment of debts and that good is the debt which a just man owes to his friends and evil the debt which he owes to his enemies to say this is not wise for it is not true if as has been clearly shown the injuring of another can be in no case just
i agree with you said polemarchus
then you and i are prepared to take up arms against any one who attributes such a saying to simonides or bias or pittacus or any other wise man or seer
i am quite ready to do battle at your side he said
shall i tell you whose i believe the saying to be
whose
i believe that periander or perdiccas or xerxes or ismenias the theban or some other rich and mighty man who had a great opinion of his own power was the first to say that justice is doing good to your friends and harm to your enemies
most true he said
yes i said but if this definition of justice also breaks down what other can be offered
several times in the course of the discussion thrasymachus had made an attempt to get the argument into his own hands and had been put down by the rest of the company who wanted to hear the end
but when polemarchus and i had done speaking and there was a pause he could no longer hold his peace and gathering himself up he came at us like a wild beast seeking to devour us
we were quite panic stricken at the sight of him
he roared out to the whole company what folly socrates has taken possession of you all
and why sillybillies do you knock under to one another
i say that if you want really to know what justice is you should not only ask but answer and you should not seek honour to yourself from the refutation of an opponent but have your own answer for there is many a one who can ask and cannot answer
and now i will not have you say that justice is duty or advantage or profit or gain or interest for this sort of nonsense will not do for me i must have clearness and accuracy
i was panic stricken at his words and could not look at him without trembling
indeed i believe that if i had not fixed my eye upon him i should have been struck dumb but when i saw his fury rising i looked at him first and was therefore able to reply to him
thrasymachus i said with a quiver don t be hard upon us
polemarchus and i may have been guilty of a little mistake in the argument but i can assure you that the error was not intentional
if we were seeking for a piece of gold you would not imagine that we were knocking under to one another and so losing our chance of finding it
and why when we are seeking for justice a thing more precious than many pieces of gold do you say that we are weakly yielding to one another and not doing our utmost to get at the truth
nay my good friend we are most willing and anxious to do so but the fact is that we cannot
and if so you people who know all things should pity us and not be angry with us
how characteristic of socrates
he replied with a bitter laugh that s your ironical style
did i not foresee have i not already told you that whatever he was asked he would refuse to answer and try irony or any other shuffle in order that he might avoid answering
you are a philosopher thrasymachus i replied and well know that if you ask a person what numbers make up twelve taking care to prohibit him whom you ask from answering twice six or three times four or six times two or four times three for this sort of nonsense will not do for me then obviously if that is your way of putting the question no one can answer you
but suppose that he were to retort thrasymachus what do you mean
if one of these numbers which you interdict be the true answer to the question am i falsely to say some other number which is not the right one
is that your meaning
how would you answer him
just as if the two cases were at all alike
he said
why should they not be
i replied and even if they are not but only appear to be so to the person who is asked ought he not to say what he thinks whether you and i forbid him or not
i presume then that you are going to make one of the interdicted answers
i dare say that i may notwithstanding the danger if upon reflection i approve of any of them
but what if i give you an answer about justice other and better he said than any of these
what do you deserve to have done to you
done to me
as becomes the ignorant i must learn from the wise that is what i deserve to have done to me
what and no payment
a pleasant notion
i will pay when i have the money i replied
but you have socrates said glaucon and you thrasymachus need be under no anxiety about money for we will all make a contribution for socrates
yes he replied and then socrates will do as he always does refuse to answer himself but take and pull to pieces the answer of some one else
why my good friend i said how can any one answer who knows and says that he knows just nothing and who even if he has some faint notions of his own is told by a man of authority not to utter them
the natural thing is that the speaker should be some one like yourself who professes to know and can tell what he knows
will you then kindly answer for the edification of the company and of myself
glaucon and the rest of the company joined in my request and thrasymachus as any one might see was in reality eager to speak for he thought that he had an excellent answer and would distinguish himself
but at first he affected to insist on my answering at length he consented to begin
behold he said the wisdom of socrates he refuses to teach himself and goes about learning of others to whom he never even says thank you
that i learn of others i replied is quite true but that i am ungrateful i wholly deny
money i have none and therefore i pay in praise which is all i have and how ready i am to praise any one who appears to me to speak well you will very soon find out when you answer for i expect that you will answer well
listen then he said i proclaim that justice is nothing else than the interest of the stronger
and now why do you not praise me
but of course you won t
let me first understand you i replied
justice as you say is the interest of the stronger
what thrasymachus is the meaning of this
you cannot mean to say that because polydamas the pancratiast is stronger than we are and finds the eating of beef conducive to his bodily strength that to eat beef is therefore equally for our good who are weaker than he is and right and just for us
that s abominable of you socrates you take the words in the sense which is most damaging to the argument
not at all my good sir i said i am trying to understand them and i wish that you would be a little clearer
well he said have you never heard that forms of government differ there are tyrannies and there are democracies and there are aristocracies
yes i know
and the government is the ruling power in each state
certainly
and the different forms of government make laws democratical aristocratical tyrannical with a view to their several interests and these laws which are made by them for their own interests are the justice which they deliver to their subjects and him who transgresses them they punish as a breaker of the law and unjust
and that is what i mean when i say that in all states there is the same principle of justice which is the interest of the government and as the government must be supposed to have power the only reasonable conclusion is that everywhere there is one principle of justice which is the interest of the stronger
now i understand you i said and whether you are right or not i will try to discover
but let me remark that in defining justice you have yourself used the word interest which you forbade me to use
it is true however that in your definition the words of the stronger are added
a small addition you must allow he said
great or small never mind about that we must first enquire whether what you are saying is the truth
now we are both agreed that justice is interest of some sort but you go on to say of the stronger about this addition i am not so sure and must therefore consider further
proceed
i will and first tell me do you admit that it is just for subjects to obey their rulers
i do
but are the rulers of states absolutely infallible or are they sometimes liable to err
to be sure he replied they are liable to err
then in making their laws they may sometimes make them rightly and sometimes not
true
when they make them rightly they make them agreeably to their interest when they are mistaken contrary to their interest you admit that
yes
and the laws which they make must be obeyed by their subjects and that is what you call justice
doubtless
then justice according to your argument is not only obedience to the interest of the stronger but the reverse
what is that you are saying
he asked
i am only repeating what you are saying i believe
but let us consider have we not admitted that the rulers may be mistaken about their own interest in what they command and also that to obey them is justice
has not that been admitted
yes
then you must also have acknowledged justice not to be for the interest of the stronger when the rulers unintentionally command things to be done which are to their own injury
for if as you say justice is the obedience which the subject renders to their commands in that case o wisest of men is there any escape from the conclusion that the weaker are commanded to do not what is for the interest but what is for the injury of the stronger
nothing can be clearer socrates said polemarchus
yes said cleitophon interposing if you are allowed to be his witness
but there is no need of any witness said polemarchus for thrasymachus himself acknowledges that rulers may sometimes command what is not for their own interest and that for subjects to obey them is justice
yes polemarchus thrasymachus said that for subjects to do what was commanded by their rulers is just
yes cleitophon but he also said that justice is the interest of the stronger and while admitting both these propositions he further acknowledged that the stronger may command the weaker who are his subjects to do what is not for his own interest whence follows that justice is the injury quite as much as the interest of the stronger
but said cleitophon he meant by the interest of the stronger what the stronger thought to be his interest this was what the weaker had to do and this was affirmed by him to be justice
those were not his words rejoined polemarchus
never mind i replied if he now says that they are let us accept his statement
tell me thrasymachus i said did you mean by justice what the stronger thought to be his interest whether really so or not
certainly not he said
do you suppose that i call him who is mistaken the stronger at the time when he is mistaken
yes i said my impression was that you did so when you admitted that the ruler was not infallible but might be sometimes mistaken
you argue like an informer socrates
do you mean for example that he who is mistaken about the sick is a physician in that he is mistaken
or that he who errs in arithmetic or grammar is an arithmetician or grammarian at the time when he is making the mistake in respect of the mistake
true we say that the physician or arithmetician or grammarian has made a mistake but this is only a way of speaking for the fact is that neither the grammarian nor any other person of skill ever makes a mistake in so far as he is what his name implies they none of them err unless their skill fails them and then they cease to be skilled artists
no artist or sage or ruler errs at the time when he is what his name implies though he is commonly said to err and i adopted the common mode of speaking
but to be perfectly accurate since you are such a lover of accuracy we should say that the ruler in so far as he is a ruler is unerring and being unerring always commands that which is for his own interest and the subject is required to execute his commands and therefore as i said at first and now repeat justice is the interest of the stronger
indeed thrasymachus and do i really appear to you to argue like an informer
certainly he replied
and do you suppose that i ask these questions with any design of injuring you in the argument
nay he replied suppose is not the word i know it but you will be found out and by sheer force of argument you will never prevail
i shall not make the attempt my dear man but to avoid any misunderstanding occurring between us in future let me ask in what sense do you speak of a ruler or stronger whose interest as you were saying he being the superior it is just that the inferior should execute is he a ruler in the popular or in the strict sense of the term
in the strictest of all senses he said
and now cheat and play the informer if you can i ask no quarter at your hands
but you never will be able never
and do you imagine i said that i am such a madman as to try and cheat thrasymachus
i might as well shave a lion
why he said you made the attempt a minute ago and you failed
enough i said of these civilities
it will be better that i should ask you a question is the physician taken in that strict sense of which you are speaking a healer of the sick or a maker of money
and remember that i am now speaking of the true physician
a healer of the sick he replied
and the pilot that is to say the true pilot is he a captain of sailors or a mere sailor
a captain of sailors
the circumstance that he sails in the ship is not to be taken into account neither is he to be called a sailor the name pilot by which he is distinguished has nothing to do with sailing but is significant of his skill and of his authority over the sailors
very true he said
now i said every art has an interest
certainly
for which the art has to consider and provide
yes that is the aim of art
and the interest of any art is the perfection of it this and nothing else
what do you mean
i mean what i may illustrate negatively by the example of the body
suppose you were to ask me whether the body is self sufficing or has wants i should reply certainly the body has wants for the body may be ill and require to be cured and has therefore interests to which the art of medicine ministers and this is the origin and intention of medicine as you will acknowledge
am i not right
quite right he replied
but is the art of medicine or any other art faulty or deficient in any quality in the same way that the eye may be deficient in sight or the ear fail of hearing and therefore requires another art to provide for the interests of seeing and hearing has art in itself i say any similar liability to fault or defect and does every art require another supplementary art to provide for its interests and that another and another without end
or have the arts to look only after their own interests
or have they no need either of themselves or of another
having no faults or defects they have no need to correct them either by the exercise of their own art or of any other they have only to consider the interest of their subject matter
for every art remains pure and faultless while remaining true that is to say while perfect and unimpaired
take the words in your precise sense and tell me whether i am not right
yes clearly
then medicine does not consider the interest of medicine but the interest of the body
true he said
nor does the art of horsemanship consider the interests of the art of horsemanship but the interests of the horse neither do any other arts care for themselves for they have no needs they care only for that which is the subject of their art
true he said
but surely thrasymachus the arts are the superiors and rulers of their own subjects
to this he assented with a good deal of reluctance
then i said no science or art considers or enjoins the interest of the stronger or superior but only the interest of the subject and weaker
he made an attempt to contest this proposition also but finally acquiesced
then i continued no physician in so far as he is a physician considers his own good in what he prescribes but the good of his patient for the true physician is also a ruler having the human body as a subject and is not a mere money maker that has been admitted
yes
and the pilot likewise in the strict sense of the term is a ruler of sailors and not a mere sailor
that has been admitted
and such a pilot and ruler will provide and prescribe for the interest of the sailor who is under him and not for his own or the ruler s interest
he gave a reluctant yes
then i said thrasymachus there is no one in any rule who in so far as he is a ruler considers or enjoins what is for his own interest but always what is for the interest of his subject or suitable to his art to that he looks and that alone he considers in everything which he says and does
when we had got to this point in the argument and every one saw that the definition of justice had been completely upset thrasymachus instead of replying to me said tell me socrates have you got a nurse
why do you ask such a question i said when you ought rather to be answering
because she leaves you to snivel and never wipes your nose she has not even taught you to know the shepherd from the sheep
what makes you say that
i replied
because you fancy that the shepherd or neatherd fattens or tends the sheep or oxen with a view to their own good and not to the good of himself or his master and you further imagine that the rulers of states if they are true rulers never think of their subjects as sheep and that they are not studying their own advantage day and night
oh no and so entirely astray are you in your ideas about the just and unjust as not even to know that justice and the just are in reality another s good that is to say the interest of the ruler and stronger and the loss of the subject and servant and injustice the opposite for the unjust is lord over the truly simple and just he is the stronger and his subjects do what is for his interest and minister to his happiness which is very far from being their own
consider further most foolish socrates that the just is always a loser in comparison with the unjust
first of all in private contracts wherever the unjust is the partner of the just you will find that when the partnership is dissolved the unjust man has always more and the just less
secondly in their dealings with the state when there is an income tax the just man will pay more and the unjust less on the same amount of income and when there is anything to be received the one gains nothing and the other much
observe also what happens when they take an office there is the just man neglecting his affairs and perhaps suffering other losses and getting nothing out of the public because he is just moreover he is hated by his friends and acquaintance for refusing to serve them in unlawful ways
but all this is reversed in the case of the unjust man
i am speaking as before of injustice on a large scale in which the advantage of the unjust is most apparent and my meaning will be most clearly seen if we turn to that highest form of injustice in which the criminal is the happiest of men and the sufferers or those who refuse to do injustice are the most miserable that is to say tyranny which by fraud and force takes away the property of others not little by little but wholesale comprehending in one things sacred as well as profane private and public for which acts of wrong if he were detected perpetrating any one of them singly he would be punished and incur great disgrace they who do such wrong in particular cases are called robbers of temples and man stealers and burglars and swindlers and thieves
but when a man besides taking away the money of the citizens has made slaves of them then instead of these names of reproach he is termed happy and blessed not only by the citizens but by all who hear of his having achieved the consummation of injustice
for mankind censure injustice fearing that they may be the victims of it and not because they shrink from committing it
and thus as i have shown socrates injustice when on a sufficient scale has more strength and freedom and mastery than justice and as i said at first justice is the interest of the stronger whereas injustice is a man s own profit and interest
thrasymachus when he had thus spoken having like a bath man deluged our ears with his words had a mind to go away
but the company would not let him they insisted that he should remain and defend his position and i myself added my own humble request that he would not leave us
thrasymachus i said to him excellent man how suggestive are your remarks
and are you going to run away before you have fairly taught or learned whether they are true or not
is the attempt to determine the way of man s life so small a matter in your eyes to determine how life may be passed by each one of us to the greatest advantage
and do i differ from you he said as to the importance of the enquiry
you appear rather i replied to have no care or thought about us thrasymachus whether we live better or worse from not knowing what you say you know is to you a matter of indifference
prithee friend do not keep your knowledge to yourself we are a large party and any benefit which you confer upon us will be amply rewarded
for my own part i openly declare that i am not convinced and that i do not believe injustice to be more gainful than justice even if uncontrolled and allowed to have free play
for granting that there may be an unjust man who is able to commit injustice either by fraud or force still this does not convince me of the superior advantage of injustice and there may be others who are in the same predicament with myself
perhaps we may be wrong if so you in your wisdom should convince us that we are mistaken in preferring justice to injustice
and how am i to convince you he said if you are not already convinced by what i have just said what more can i do for you
would you have me put the proof bodily into your souls
heaven forbid
i said i would only ask you to be consistent or if you change change openly and let there be no deception
for i must remark thrasymachus if you will recall what was previously said that although you began by defining the true physician in an exact sense you did not observe a like exactness when speaking of the shepherd you thought that the shepherd as a shepherd tends the sheep not with a view to their own good but like a mere diner or banquetter with a view to the pleasures of the table or again as a trader for sale in the market and not as a shepherd
yet surely the art of the shepherd is concerned only with the good of his subjects he has only to provide the best for them since the perfection of the art is already ensured whenever all the requirements of it are satisfied
and that was what i was saying just now about the ruler
i conceived that the art of the ruler considered as ruler whether in a state or in private life could only regard the good of his flock or subjects whereas you seem to think that the rulers in states that is to say the true rulers like being in authority
think
nay i am sure of it
then why in the case of lesser offices do men never take them willingly without payment unless under the idea that they govern for the advantage not of themselves but of others
let me ask you a question are not the several arts different by reason of their each having a separate function
and my dear illustrious friend do say what you think that we may make a little progress
yes that is the difference he replied
and each art gives us a particular good and not merely a general one medicine for example gives us health navigation safety at sea and so on
yes he said
and the art of payment has the special function of giving pay but we do not confuse this with other arts any more than the art of the pilot is to be confused with the art of medicine because the health of the pilot may be improved by a sea voyage
you would not be inclined to say would you that navigation is the art of medicine at least if we are to adopt your exact use of language
certainly not
or because a man is in good health when he receives pay you would not say that the art of payment is medicine
i should not
nor would you say that medicine is the art of receiving pay because a man takes fees when he is engaged in healing
certainly not
and we have admitted i said that the good of each art is specially confined to the art
yes
then if there be any good which all artists have in common that is to be attributed to something of which they all have the common use
true he replied
and when the artist is benefited by receiving pay the advantage is gained by an additional use of the art of pay which is not the art professed by him
he gave a reluctant assent to this
then the pay is not derived by the several artists from their respective arts
but the truth is that while the art of medicine gives health and the art of the builder builds a house another art attends them which is the art of pay
the various arts may be doing their own business and benefiting that over which they preside but would the artist receive any benefit from his art unless he were paid as well
i suppose not
but does he therefore confer no benefit when he works for nothing
certainly he confers a benefit
then now thrasymachus there is no longer any doubt that neither arts nor governments provide for their own interests but as we were before saying they rule and provide for the interests of their subjects who are the weaker and not the stronger to their good they attend and not to the good of the superior
and this is the reason my dear thrasymachus why as i was just now saying no one is willing to govern because no one likes to take in hand the reformation of evils which are not his concern without remuneration
for in the execution of his work and in giving his orders to another the true artist does not regard his own interest but always that of his subjects and therefore in order that rulers may be willing to rule they must be paid in one of three modes of payment money or honour or a penalty for refusing
what do you mean socrates
said glaucon
the first two modes of payment are intelligible enough but what the penalty is i do not understand or how a penalty can be a payment
you mean that you do not understand the nature of this payment which to the best men is the great inducement to rule
of course you know that ambition and avarice are held to be as indeed they are a disgrace
very true
and for this reason i said money and honour have no attraction for them good men do not wish to be openly demanding payment for governing and so to get the name of hirelings nor by secretly helping themselves out of the public revenues to get the name of thieves
and not being ambitious they do not care about honour
wherefore necessity must be laid upon them and they must be induced to serve from the fear of punishment
and this as i imagine is the reason why the forwardness to take office instead of waiting to be compelled has been deemed dishonourable
now the worst part of the punishment is that he who refuses to rule is liable to be ruled by one who is worse than himself
and the fear of this as i conceive induces the good to take office not because they would but because they cannot help not under the idea that they are going to have any benefit or enjoyment themselves but as a necessity and because they are not able to commit the task of ruling to any one who is better than themselves or indeed as good
for there is reason to think that if a city were composed entirely of good men then to avoid office would be as much an object of contention as to obtain office is at present then we should have plain proof that the true ruler is not meant by nature to regard his own interest but that of his subjects and every one who knew this would choose rather to receive a benefit from another than to have the trouble of conferring one
so far am i from agreeing with thrasymachus that justice is the interest of the stronger
this latter question need not be further discussed at present but when thrasymachus says that the life of the unjust is more advantageous than that of the just his new statement appears to me to be of a far more serious character
which of us has spoken truly
and which sort of life glaucon do you prefer
i for my part deem the life of the just to be the more advantageous he answered
did you hear all the advantages of the unjust which thrasymachus was rehearsing
yes i heard him he replied but he has not convinced me
then shall we try to find some way of convincing him if we can that he is saying what is not true
most certainly he replied
if i said he makes a set speech and we make another recounting all the advantages of being just and he answers and we rejoin there must be a numbering and measuring of the goods which are claimed on either side and in the end we shall want judges to decide but if we proceed in our enquiry as we lately did by making admissions to one another we shall unite the offices of judge and advocate in our own persons
very good he said
and which method do i understand you to prefer
i said
that which you propose
well then thrasymachus i said suppose you begin at the beginning and answer me
you say that perfect injustice is more gainful than perfect justice
yes that is what i say and i have given you my reasons
and what is your view about them
would you call one of them virtue and the other vice
certainly
i suppose that you would call justice virtue and injustice vice
what a charming notion
so likely too seeing that i affirm injustice to be profitable and justice not
what else then would you say
the opposite he replied
and would you call justice vice
no i would rather say sublime simplicity
then would you call injustice malignity
no i would rather say discretion
and do the unjust appear to you to be wise and good
yes he said at any rate those of them who are able to be perfectly unjust and who have the power of subduing states and nations but perhaps you imagine me to be talking of cutpurses
even this profession if undetected has advantages though they are not to be compared with those of which i was just now speaking
i do not think that i misapprehend your meaning thrasymachus i replied but still i cannot hear without amazement that you class injustice with wisdom and virtue and justice with the opposite
certainly i do so class them
now i said you are on more substantial and almost unanswerable ground for if the injustice which you were maintaining to be profitable had been admitted by you as by others to be vice and deformity an answer might have been given to you on received principles but now i perceive that you will call injustice honourable and strong and to the unjust you will attribute all the qualities which were attributed by us before to the just seeing that you do not hesitate to rank injustice with wisdom and virtue
you have guessed most infallibly he replied
then i certainly ought not to shrink from going through with the argument so long as i have reason to think that you thrasymachus are speaking your real mind for i do believe that you are now in earnest and are not amusing yourself at our expense
i may be in earnest or not but what is that to you
to refute the argument is your business
very true i said that is what i have to do but will you be so good as answer yet one more question
does the just man try to gain any advantage over the just
far otherwise if he did he would not be the simple amusing creature which he is
and would he try to go beyond just action
he would not
and how would he regard the attempt to gain an advantage over the unjust would that be considered by him as just or unjust
he would think it just and would try to gain the advantage but he would not be able
whether he would or would not be able i said is not to the point
my question is only whether the just man while refusing to have more than another just man would wish and claim to have more than the unjust
yes he would
and what of the unjust does he claim to have more than the just man and to do more than is just
of course he said for he claims to have more than all men
and the unjust man will strive and struggle to obtain more than the unjust man or action in order that he may have more than all
true
we may put the matter thus i said the just does not desire more than his like but more than his unlike whereas the unjust desires more than both his like and his unlike
nothing he said can be better than that statement
and the unjust is good and wise and the just is neither
good again he said
and is not the unjust like the wise and good and the just unlike them
of course he said he who is of a certain nature is like those who are of a certain nature he who is not not
each of them i said is such as his like is
certainly he replied
very good thrasymachus i said and now to take the case of the arts you would admit that one man is a musician and another not a musician
yes
and which is wise and which is foolish
clearly the musician is wise and he who is not a musician is foolish
and he is good in as far as he is wise and bad in as far as he is foolish
yes
and you would say the same sort of thing of the physician
yes
and do you think my excellent friend that a musician when he adjusts the lyre would desire or claim to exceed or go beyond a musician in the tightening and loosening the strings
i do not think that he would
but he would claim to exceed the non musician
of course
and what would you say of the physician
in prescribing meats and drinks would he wish to go beyond another physician or beyond the practice of medicine
he would not
but he would wish to go beyond the non physician
yes
and about knowledge and ignorance in general see whether you think that any man who has knowledge ever would wish to have the choice of saying or doing more than another man who has knowledge
would he not rather say or do the same as his like in the same case
that i suppose can hardly be denied
and what of the ignorant
would he not desire to have more than either the knowing or the ignorant
i dare say
and the knowing is wise
yes
and the wise is good
true
then the wise and good will not desire to gain more than his like but more than his unlike and opposite
i suppose so
whereas the bad and ignorant will desire to gain more than both
yes
but did we not say thrasymachus that the unjust goes beyond both his like and unlike
were not these your words
they were
and you also said that the just will not go beyond his like but his unlike
yes
then the just is like the wise and good and the unjust like the evil and ignorant
that is the inference
and each of them is such as his like is
that was admitted
then the just has turned out to be wise and good and the unjust evil and ignorant
thrasymachus made all these admissions not fluently as i repeat them but with extreme reluctance it was a hot summer s day and the perspiration poured from him in torrents and then i saw what i had never seen before thrasymachus blushing
as we were now agreed that justice was virtue and wisdom and injustice vice and ignorance i proceeded to another point well i said thrasymachus that matter is now settled but were we not also saying that injustice had strength do you remember
yes i remember he said but do not suppose that i approve of what you are saying or have no answer if however i were to answer you would be quite certain to accuse me of haranguing therefore either permit me to have my say out or if you would rather ask do so and i will answer very good as they say to story telling old women and will nod yes and no
certainly not i said if contrary to your real opinion
yes he said i will to please you since you will not let me speak
what else would you have
nothing in the world i said and if you are so disposed i will ask and you shall answer
proceed
then i will repeat the question which i asked before in order that our examination of the relative nature of justice and injustice may be carried on regularly
a statement was made that injustice is stronger and more powerful than justice but now justice having been identified with wisdom and virtue is easily shown to be stronger than injustice if injustice is ignorance this can no longer be questioned by any one
but i want to view the matter thrasymachus in a different way you would not deny that a state may be unjust and may be unjustly attempting to enslave other states or may have already enslaved them and may be holding many of them in subjection
true he replied and i will add that the best and most perfectly unjust state will be most likely to do so
i know i said that such was your position but what i would further consider is whether this power which is possessed by the superior state can exist or be exercised without justice or only with justice
if you are right in your view and justice is wisdom then only with justice but if i am right then without justice
i am delighted thrasymachus to see you not only nodding assent and dissent but making answers which are quite excellent
that is out of civility to you he replied
you are very kind i said and would you have the goodness also to inform me whether you think that a state or an army or a band of robbers and thieves or any other gang of evil doers could act at all if they injured one another
no indeed he said they could not
but if they abstained from injuring one another then they might act together better
yes
and this is because injustice creates divisions and hatreds and fighting and justice imparts harmony and friendship is not that true thrasymachus
i agree he said because i do not wish to quarrel with you
how good of you i said but i should like to know also whether injustice having this tendency to arouse hatred wherever existing among slaves or among freemen will not make them hate one another and set them at variance and render them incapable of common action
certainly
and even if injustice be found in two only will they not quarrel and fight and become enemies to one another and to the just
they will
and suppose injustice abiding in a single person would your wisdom say that she loses or that she retains her natural power
let us assume that she retains her power
yet is not the power which injustice exercises of such a nature that wherever she takes up her abode whether in a city in an army in a family or in any other body that body is to begin with rendered incapable of united action by reason of sedition and distraction and does it not become its own enemy and at variance with all that opposes it and with the just
is not this the case
yes certainly
and is not injustice equally fatal when existing in a single person in the first place rendering him incapable of action because he is not at unity with himself and in the second place making him an enemy to himself and the just
is not that true thrasymachus
yes
and o my friend i said surely the gods are just
granted that they are
but if so the unjust will be the enemy of the gods and the just will be their friend
feast away in triumph and take your fill of the argument i will not oppose you lest i should displease the company
well then proceed with your answers and let me have the remainder of my repast
for we have already shown that the just are clearly wiser and better and abler than the unjust and that the unjust are incapable of common action nay more that to speak as we did of men who are evil acting at any time vigorously together is not strictly true for if they had been perfectly evil they would have laid hands upon one another but it is evident that there must have been some remnant of justice in them which enabled them to combine if there had not been they would have injured one another as well as their victims they were but half villains in their enterprises for had they been whole villains and utterly unjust they would have been utterly incapable of action
that as i believe is the truth of the matter and not what you said at first
but whether the just have a better and happier life than the unjust is a further question which we also proposed to consider
i think that they have and for the reasons which i have given but still i should like to examine further for no light matter is at stake nothing less than the rule of human life
proceed
i will proceed by asking a question would you not say that a horse has some end
i should
and the end or use of a horse or of anything would be that which could not be accomplished or not so well accomplished by any other thing
i do not understand he said
let me explain can you see except with the eye
certainly not
or hear except with the ear
no
these then may be truly said to be the ends of these organs
they may
but you can cut off a vine branch with a dagger or with a chisel and in many other ways
of course
and yet not so well as with a pruning hook made for the purpose
true
may we not say that this is the end of a pruning hook
we may
then now i think you will have no difficulty in understanding my meaning when i asked the question whether the end of anything would be that which could not be accomplished or not so well accomplished by any other thing
i understand your meaning he said and assent
and that to which an end is appointed has also an excellence
need i ask again whether the eye has an end
it has
and has not the eye an excellence
yes
and the ear has an end and an excellence also
true
and the same is true of all other things they have each of them an end and a special excellence
that is so
well and can the eyes fulfil their end if they are wanting in their own proper excellence and have a defect instead
how can they he said if they are blind and cannot see
you mean to say if they have lost their proper excellence which is sight but i have not arrived at that point yet
i would rather ask the question more generally and only enquire whether the things which fulfil their ends fulfil them by their own proper excellence and fail of fulfilling them by their own defect
certainly he replied
i might say the same of the ears when deprived of their own proper excellence they cannot fulfil their end
true
and the same observation will apply to all other things
i agree
well and has not the soul an end which nothing else can fulfil
for example to superintend and command and deliberate and the like
are not these functions proper to the soul and can they rightly be assigned to any other
to no other
and is not life to be reckoned among the ends of the soul
assuredly he said
and has not the soul an excellence also
yes
and can she or can she not fulfil her own ends when deprived of that excellence
she cannot
then an evil soul must necessarily be an evil ruler and superintendent and the good soul a good ruler
yes necessarily
and we have admitted that justice is the excellence of the soul and injustice the defect of the soul
that has been admitted
then the just soul and the just man will live well and the unjust man will live ill
that is what your argument proves
and he who lives well is blessed and happy and he who lives ill the reverse of happy
certainly
then the just is happy and the unjust miserable
so be it
but happiness and not misery is profitable
of course
then my blessed thrasymachus injustice can never be more profitable than justice
let this socrates he said be your entertainment at the bendidea
for which i am indebted to you i said now that you have grown gentle towards me and have left off scolding
nevertheless i have not been well entertained but that was my own fault and not yours
as an epicure snatches a taste of every dish which is successively brought to table he not having allowed himself time to enjoy the one before so have i gone from one subject to another without having discovered what i sought at first the nature of justice
i left that enquiry and turned away to consider whether justice is virtue and wisdom or evil and folly and when there arose a further question about the comparative advantages of justice and injustice i could not refrain from passing on to that
and the result of the whole discussion has been that i know nothing at all
for i know not what justice is and therefore i am not likely to know whether it is or is not a virtue nor can i say whether the just man is happy or unhappy
book ii
with these words i was thinking that i had made an end of the discussion but the end in truth proved to be only a beginning
for glaucon who is always the most pugnacious of men was dissatisfied at thrasymachus retirement he wanted to have the battle out
so he said to me socrates do you wish really to persuade us or only to seem to have persuaded us that to be just is always better than to be unjust
i should wish really to persuade you i replied if i could
then you certainly have not succeeded
let me ask you now how would you arrange goods are there not some which we welcome for their own sakes and independently of their consequences as for example harmless pleasures and enjoyments which delight us at the time although nothing follows from them
i agree in thinking that there is such a class i replied
is there not also a second class of goods such as knowledge sight health which are desirable not only in themselves but also for their results
certainly i said
and would you not recognize a third class such as gymnastic and the care of the sick and the physician s art also the various ways of money making these do us good but we regard them as disagreeable and no one would choose them for their own sakes but only for the sake of some reward or result which flows from them
there is i said this third class also
but why do you ask
because i want to know in which of the three classes you would place justice
in the highest class i replied among those goods which he who would be happy desires both for their own sake and for the sake of their results
then the many are of another mind they think that justice is to be reckoned in the troublesome class among goods which are to be pursued for the sake of rewards and of reputation but in themselves are disagreeable and rather to be avoided
i know i said that this is their manner of thinking and that this was the thesis which thrasymachus was maintaining just now when he censured justice and praised injustice
but i am too stupid to be convinced by him
i wish he said that you would hear me as well as him and then i shall see whether you and i agree
for thrasymachus seems to me like a snake to have been charmed by your voice sooner than he ought to have been but to my mind the nature of justice and injustice have not yet been made clear
setting aside their rewards and results i want to know what they are in themselves and how they inwardly work in the soul
if you please then i will revive the argument of thrasymachus
and first i will speak of the nature and origin of justice according to the common view of them
secondly i will show that all men who practise justice do so against their will of necessity but not as a good
and thirdly i will argue that there is reason in this view for the life of the unjust is after all better far than the life of the just if what they say is true socrates since i myself am not of their opinion
but still i acknowledge that i am perplexed when i hear the voices of thrasymachus and myriads of others dinning in my ears and on the other hand i have never yet heard the superiority of justice to injustice maintained by any one in a satisfactory way
i want to hear justice praised in respect of itself then i shall be satisfied and you are the person from whom i think that i am most likely to hear this and therefore i will praise the unjust life to the utmost of my power and my manner of speaking will indicate the manner in which i desire to hear you too praising justice and censuring injustice
will you say whether you approve of my proposal
indeed i do nor can i imagine any theme about which a man of sense would oftener wish to converse
i am delighted he replied to hear you say so and shall begin by speaking as i proposed of the nature and origin of justice
they say that to do injustice is by nature good to suffer injustice evil but that the evil is greater than the good
and so when men have both done and suffered injustice and have had experience of both not being able to avoid the one and obtain the other they think that they had better agree among themselves to have neither hence there arise laws and mutual covenants and that which is ordained by law is termed by them lawful and just
this they affirm to be the origin and nature of justice it is a mean or compromise between the best of all which is to do injustice and not be punished and the worst of all which is to suffer injustice without the power of retaliation and justice being at a middle point between the two is tolerated not as a good but as the lesser evil and honoured by reason of the inability of men to do injustice
for no man who is worthy to be called a man would ever submit to such an agreement if he were able to resist he would be mad if he did
such is the received account socrates of the nature and origin of justice
now that those who practise justice do so involuntarily and because they have not the power to be unjust will best appear if we imagine something of this kind having given both to the just and the unjust power to do what they will let us watch and see whither desire will lead them then we shall discover in the very act the just and unjust man to be proceeding along the same road following their interest which all natures deem to be their good and are only diverted into the path of justice by the force of law
the liberty which we are supposing may be most completely given to them in the form of such a power as is said to have been possessed by gyges the ancestor of croesus the lydian
according to the tradition gyges was a shepherd in the service of the king of lydia there was a great storm and an earthquake made an opening in the earth at the place where he was feeding his flock
amazed at the sight he descended into the opening where among other marvels he beheld a hollow brazen horse having doors at which he stooping and looking in saw a dead body of stature as appeared to him more than human and having nothing on but a gold ring this he took from the finger of the dead and reascended
now the shepherds met together according to custom that they might send their monthly report about the flocks to the king into their assembly he came having the ring on his finger and as he was sitting among them he chanced to turn the collet of the ring inside his hand when instantly he became invisible to the rest of the company and they began to speak of him as if he were no longer present
he was astonished at this and again touching the ring he turned the collet outwards and reappeared he made several trials of the ring and always with the same result when he turned the collet inwards he became invisible when outwards he reappeared
whereupon he contrived to be chosen one of the messengers who were sent to the court whereas soon as he arrived he seduced the queen and with her help conspired against the king and slew him and took the kingdom
suppose now that there were two such magic rings and the just put on one of them and the unjust the other no man can be imagined to be of such an iron nature that he would stand fast in justice
no man would keep his hands off what was not his own when he could safely take what he liked out of the market or go into houses and lie with any one at his pleasure or kill or release from prison whom he would and in all respects be like a god among men
then the actions of the just would be as the actions of the unjust they would both come at last to the same point
and this we may truly affirm to be a great proof that a man is just not willingly or because he thinks that justice is any good to him individually but of necessity for wherever any one thinks that he can safely be unjust there he is unjust
for all men believe in their hearts that injustice is far more profitable to the individual than justice and he who argues as i have been supposing will say that they are right
if you could imagine any one obtaining this power of becoming invisible and never doing any wrong or touching what was another s he would be thought by the lookers on to be a most wretched idiot although they would praise him to one another s faces and keep up appearances with one another from a fear that they too might suffer injustice
enough of this
now if we are to form a real judgment of the life of the just and unjust we must isolate them there is no other way and how is the isolation to be effected
i answer let the unjust man be entirely unjust and the just man entirely just nothing is to be taken away from either of them and both are to be perfectly furnished for the work of their respective lives
first let the unjust be like other distinguished masters of craft like the skilful pilot or physician who knows intuitively his own powers and keeps within their limits and who if he fails at any point is able to recover himself
so let the unjust make his unjust attempts in the right way and lie hidden if he means to be great in his injustice for the highest reach of injustice is to be deemed just when you are not
therefore i say that in the perfectly unjust man we must assume the most perfect injustice there is to be no deduction but we must allow him while doing the most unjust acts to have acquired the greatest reputation for justice
if he have taken a false step he must be able to recover himself he must be one who can speak with effect if any of his deeds come to light and who can force his way where force is required by his courage and strength and command of money and friends
and at his side let us place the just man in his nobleness and simplicity wishing as aeschylus says to be and not to seem good
there must be no seeming for if he seem to be just he will be honoured and rewarded and then we shall not know whether he is just for the sake of justice or for the sake of honours and rewards therefore let him be clothed in justice only and have no other covering and he must be imagined in a state of life the opposite of the former
let him be the best of men and let him be thought the worst then he will have been put to the proof and we shall see whether he will be affected by the fear of infamy and its consequences
and let him continue thus to the hour of death being just and seeming to be unjust
when both have reached the uttermost extreme the one of justice and the other of injustice let judgment be given which of them is the happier of the two
heavens
my dear glaucon i said how energetically you polish them up for the decision first one and then the other as if they were two statues
i do my best he said
and now that we know what they are like there is no difficulty in tracing out the sort of life which awaits either of them
this i will proceed to describe but as you may think the description a little too coarse i ask you to suppose socrates that the words which follow are not mine
let me put them into the mouths of the eulogists of injustice they will tell you that the just man who is thought unjust will be scourged racked bound will have his eyes burnt out and at last after suffering every kind of evil he will be impaled then he will understand that he ought to seem only and not to be just the words of aeschylus may be more truly spoken of the unjust than of the just
for the unjust is pursuing a reality he does not live with a view to appearances he wants to be really unjust and not to seem only his mind has a soil deep and fertile out of which spring his prudent counsels
in the first place he is thought just and therefore bears rule in the city he can marry whom he will and give in marriage to whom he will also he can trade and deal where he likes and always to his own advantage because he has no misgivings about injustice and at every contest whether in public or private he gets the better of his antagonists and gains at their expense and is rich and out of his gains he can benefit his friends and harm his enemies moreover he can offer sacrifices and dedicate gifts to the gods abundantly and magnificently and can honour the gods or any man whom he wants to honour in a far better style than the just and therefore he is likely to be dearer than they are to the gods
and thus socrates gods and men are said to unite in making the life of the unjust better than the life of the just
i was going to say something in answer to glaucon when adeimantus his brother interposed socrates he said you do not suppose that there is nothing more to be urged
why what else is there
i answered
the strongest point of all has not been even mentioned he replied
well then according to the proverb let brother help brother if he fails in any part do you assist him although i must confess that glaucon has already said quite enough to lay me in the dust and take from me the power of helping justice
nonsense he replied
but let me add something more there is another side to glaucon s argument about the praise and censure of justice and injustice which is equally required in order to bring out what i believe to be his meaning
parents and tutors are always telling their sons and their wards that they are to be just but why
not for the sake of justice but for the sake of character and reputation in the hope of obtaining for him who is reputed just some of those offices marriages and the like which glaucon has enumerated among the advantages accruing to the unjust from the reputation of justice
more however is made of appearances by this class of persons than by the others for they throw in the good opinion of the gods and will tell you of a shower of benefits which the heavens as they say rain upon the pious and this accords with the testimony of the noble hesiod and homer the first of whom says that the gods make the oaks of the just to bear acorns at their summit and bees in the middle and the sheep are bowed down with the weight of their fleeces and many other blessings of a like kind are provided for them
and homer has a very similar strain for he speaks of one whose fame is as the fame of some blameless king who like a god maintains justice to whom the black earth brings forth wheat and barley whose trees are bowed with fruit and his sheep never fail to bear and the sea gives him fish
still grander are the gifts of heaven which musaeus and his son vouchsafe to the just they take them down into the world below where they have the saints lying on couches at a feast everlastingly drunk crowned with garlands their idea seems to be that an immortality of drunkenness is the highest meed of virtue
some extend their rewards yet further the posterity as they say of the faithful and just shall survive to the third and fourth generation
this is the style in which they praise justice
but about the wicked there is another strain they bury them in a slough in hades and make them carry water in a sieve also while they are yet living they bring them to infamy and inflict upon them the punishments which glaucon described as the portion of the just who are reputed to be unjust nothing else does their invention supply
such is their manner of praising the one and censuring the other
once more socrates i will ask you to consider another way of speaking about justice and injustice which is not confined to the poets but is found in prose writers
the universal voice of mankind is always declaring that justice and virtue are honourable but grievous and toilsome and that the pleasures of vice and injustice are easy of attainment and are only censured by law and opinion
they say also that honesty is for the most part less profitable than dishonesty and they are quite ready to call wicked men happy and to honour them both in public and private when they are rich or in any other way influential while they despise and overlook those who may be weak and poor even though acknowledging them to be better than the others
but most extraordinary of all is their mode of speaking about virtue and the gods they say that the gods apportion calamity and misery to many good men and good and happiness to the wicked
and mendicant prophets go to rich men s doors and persuade them that they have a power committed to them by the gods of making an atonement for a man s own or his ancestor s sins by sacrifices or charms with rejoicings and feasts and they promise to harm an enemy whether just or unjust at a small cost with magic arts and incantations binding heaven as they say to execute their will
and the poets are the authorities to whom they appeal now smoothing the path of vice with the words of hesiod vice may be had in abundance without trouble the way is smooth and her dwelling place is near
but before virtue the gods have set toil and a tedious and uphill road then citing homer as a witness that the gods may be influenced by men for he also says the gods too may be turned from their purpose and men pray to them and avert their wrath by sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by libations and the odour of fat when they have sinned and transgressed
and they produce a host of books written by musaeus and orpheus who were children of the moon and the muses that is what they say according to which they perform their ritual and persuade not only individuals but whole cities that expiations and atonements for sin may be made by sacrifices and amusements which fill a vacant hour and are equally at the service of the living and the dead the latter sort they call mysteries and they redeem us from the pains of hell but if we neglect them no one knows what awaits us
he proceeded and now when the young hear all this said about virtue and vice and the way in which gods and men regard them how are their minds likely to be affected my dear socrates those of them i mean who are quickwitted and like bees on the wing light on every flower and from all that they hear are prone to draw conclusions as to what manner of persons they should be and in what way they should walk if they would make the best of life
probably the youth will say to himself in the words of pindar can i by justice or by crooked ways of deceit ascend a loftier tower which may be a fortress to me all my days
for what men say is that if i am really just and am not also thought just profit there is none but the pain and loss on the other hand are unmistakeable
but if though unjust i acquire the reputation of justice a heavenly life is promised to me
since then as philosophers prove appearance tyrannizes over truth and is lord of happiness to appearance i must devote myself
i will describe around me a picture and shadow of virtue to be the vestibule and exterior of my house behind i will trail the subtle and crafty fox as archilochus greatest of sages recommends
but i hear some one exclaiming that the concealment of wickedness is often difficult to which i answer nothing great is easy
nevertheless the argument indicates this if we would be happy to be the path along which we should proceed
with a view to concealment we will establish secret brotherhoods and political clubs
and there are professors of rhetoric who teach the art of persuading courts and assemblies and so partly by persuasion and partly by force i shall make unlawful gains and not be punished
still i hear a voice saying that the gods cannot be deceived neither can they be compelled
but what if there are no gods
or suppose them to have no care of human things why in either case should we mind about concealment
and even if there are gods and they do care about us yet we know of them only from tradition and the genealogies of the poets and these are the very persons who say that they may be influenced and turned by sacrifices and soothing entreaties and by offerings
let us be consistent then and believe both or neither
if the poets speak truly why then we had better be unjust and offer of the fruits of injustice for if we are just although we may escape the vengeance of heaven we shall lose the gains of injustice but if we are unjust we shall keep the gains and by our sinning and praying and praying and sinning the gods will be propitiated and we shall not be punished
but there is a world below in which either we or our posterity will suffer for our unjust deeds
yes my friend will be the reflection but there are mysteries and atoning deities and these have great power
that is what mighty cities declare and the children of the gods who were their poets and prophets bear a like testimony
on what principle then shall we any longer choose justice rather than the worst injustice
when if we only unite the latter with a deceitful regard to appearances we shall fare to our mind both with gods and men in life and after death as the most numerous and the highest authorities tell us
knowing all this socrates how can a man who has any superiority of mind or person or rank or wealth be willing to honour justice or indeed to refrain from laughing when he hears justice praised
and even if there should be some one who is able to disprove the truth of my words and who is satisfied that justice is best still he is not angry with the unjust but is very ready to forgive them because he also knows that men are not just of their own free will unless peradventure there be some one whom the divinity within him may have inspired with a hatred of injustice or who has attained knowledge of the truth but no other man
he only blames injustice who owing to cowardice or age or some weakness has not the power of being unjust
and this is proved by the fact that when he obtains the power he immediately becomes unjust as far as he can be
the cause of all this socrates was indicated by us at the beginning of the argument when my brother and i told you how astonished we were to find that of all the professing panegyrists of justice beginning with the ancient heroes of whom any memorial has been preserved to us and ending with the men of our own time no one has ever blamed injustice or praised justice except with a view to the glories honours and benefits which flow from them
no one has ever adequately described either in verse or prose the true essential nature of either of them abiding in the soul and invisible to any human or divine eye or shown that of all the things of a man s soul which he has within him justice is the greatest good and injustice the greatest evil
had this been the universal strain had you sought to persuade us of this from our youth upwards we should not have been on the watch to keep one another from doing wrong but every one would have been his own watchman because afraid if he did wrong of harbouring in himself the greatest of evils
i dare say that thrasymachus and others would seriously hold the language which i have been merely repeating and words even stronger than these about justice and injustice grossly as i conceive perverting their true nature
but i speak in this vehement manner as i must frankly confess to you because i want to hear from you the opposite side and i would ask you to show not only the superiority which justice has over injustice but what effect they have on the possessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil to him
and please as glaucon requested of you to exclude reputations for unless you take away from each of them his true reputation and add on the false we shall say that you do not praise justice but the appearance of it we shall think that you are only exhorting us to keep injustice dark and that you really agree with thrasymachus in thinking that justice is another s good and the interest of the stronger and that injustice is a man s own profit and interest though injurious to the weaker
now as you have admitted that justice is one of that highest class of goods which are desired indeed for their results but in a far greater degree for their own sakes like sight or hearing or knowledge or health or any other real and natural and not merely conventional good i would ask you in your praise of justice to regard one point only i mean the essential good and evil which justice and injustice work in the possessors of them
let others praise justice and censure injustice magnifying the rewards and honours of the one and abusing the other that is a manner of arguing which coming from them i am ready to tolerate but from you who have spent your whole life in the consideration of this question unless i hear the contrary from your own lips i expect something better
and therefore i say not only prove to us that justice is better than injustice but show what they either of them do to the possessor of them which makes the one to be a good and the other an evil whether seen or unseen by gods and men
i had always admired the genius of glaucon and adeimantus but on hearing these words i was quite delighted and said sons of an illustrious father that was not a bad beginning of the elegiac verses which the admirer of glaucon made in honour of you after you had distinguished yourselves at the battle of megara sons of ariston he sang divine offspring of an illustrious hero
the epithet is very appropriate for there is something truly divine in being able to argue as you have done for the superiority of injustice and remaining unconvinced by your own arguments
and i do believe that you are not convinced this i infer from your general character for had i judged only from your speeches i should have mistrusted you
but now the greater my confidence in you the greater is my difficulty in knowing what to say
for i am in a strait between two on the one hand i feel that i am unequal to the task and my inability is brought home to me by the fact that you were not satisfied with the answer which i made to thrasymachus proving as i thought the superiority which justice has over injustice
and yet i cannot refuse to help while breath and speech remain to me i am afraid that there would be an impiety in being present when justice is evil spoken of and not lifting up a hand in her defence
and therefore i had best give such help as i can
glaucon and the rest entreated me by all means not to let the question drop but to proceed in the investigation
they wanted to arrive at the truth first about the nature of justice and injustice and secondly about their relative advantages
i told them what i really thought that the enquiry would be of a serious nature and would require very good eyes
seeing then i said that we are no great wits i think that we had better adopt a method which i may illustrate thus suppose that a short sighted person had been asked by some one to read small letters from a distance and it occurred to some one else that they might be found in another place which was larger and in which the letters were larger if they were the same and he could read the larger letters first and then proceed to the lesser this would have been thought a rare piece of good fortune
very true said adeimantus but how does the illustration apply to our enquiry
i will tell you i replied justice which is the subject of our enquiry is as you know sometimes spoken of as the virtue of an individual and sometimes as the virtue of a state
true he replied
and is not a state larger than an individual
it is
then in the larger the quantity of justice is likely to be larger and more easily discernible
i propose therefore that we enquire into the nature of justice and injustice first as they appear in the state and secondly in the individual proceeding from the greater to the lesser and comparing them
that he said is an excellent proposal
and if we imagine the state in process of creation we shall see the justice and injustice of the state in process of creation also
i dare say
when the state is completed there may be a hope that the object of our search will be more easily discovered
yes far more easily
but ought we to attempt to construct one
i said for to do so as i am inclined to think will be a very serious task
reflect therefore
i have reflected said adeimantus and am anxious that you should proceed
a state i said arises as i conceive out of the needs of mankind no one is self sufficing but all of us have many wants
can any other origin of a state be imagined
there can be no other
then as we have many wants and many persons are needed to supply them one takes a helper for one purpose and another for another and when these partners and helpers are gathered together in one habitation the body of inhabitants is termed a state
true he said
and they exchange with one another and one gives and another receives under the idea that the exchange will be for their good
very true
then i said let us begin and create in idea a state and yet the true creator is necessity who is the mother of our invention
of course he replied
now the first and greatest of necessities is food which is the condition of life and existence
certainly
the second is a dwelling and the third clothing and the like
true
and now let us see how our city will be able to supply this great demand we may suppose that one man is a husbandman another a builder some one else a weaver shall we add to them a shoemaker or perhaps some other purveyor to our bodily wants
quite right
the barest notion of a state must include four or five men
clearly
and how will they proceed
will each bring the result of his labours into a common stock
the individual husbandman for example producing for four and labouring four times as long and as much as he need in the provision of food with which he supplies others as well as himself or will he have nothing to do with others and not be at the trouble of producing for them but provide for himself alone a fourth of the food in a fourth of the time and in the remaining three fourths of his time be employed in making a house or a coat or a pair of shoes having no partnership with others but supplying himself all his own wants
adeimantus thought that he should aim at producing food only and not at producing everything
probably i replied that would be the better way and when i hear you say this i am myself reminded that we are not all alike there are diversities of natures among us which are adapted to different occupations
very true
and will you have a work better done when the workman has many occupations or when he has only one
when he has only one
further there can be no doubt that a work is spoilt when not done at the right time
no doubt
for business is not disposed to wait until the doer of the business is at leisure but the doer must follow up what he is doing and make the business his first object
he must
and if so we must infer that all things are produced more plentifully and easily and of a better quality when one man does one thing which is natural to him and does it at the right time and leaves other things
undoubtedly
then more than four citizens will be required for the husbandman will not make his own plough or mattock or other implements of agriculture if they are to be good for anything
neither will the builder make his tools and he too needs many and in like manner the weaver and shoemaker
true
then carpenters and smiths and many other artisans will be sharers in our little state which is already beginning to grow
true
yet even if we add neatherds shepherds and other herdsmen in order that our husbandmen may have oxen to plough with and builders as well as husbandmen may have draught cattle and curriers and weavers fleeces and hides still our state will not be very large
that is true yet neither will it be a very small state which contains all these
then again there is the situation of the city to find a place where nothing need be imported is wellnigh impossible
impossible
then there must be another class of citizens who will bring the required supply from another city
there must
but if the trader goes empty handed having nothing which they require who would supply his need he will come back empty handed
that is certain
and therefore what they produce at home must be not only enough for themselves but such both in quantity and quality as to accommodate those from whom their wants are supplied
very true
then more husbandmen and more artisans will be required
they will
not to mention the importers and exporters who are called merchants
yes
then we shall want merchants
we shall
and if merchandise is to be carried over the sea skilful sailors will also be needed and in considerable numbers
yes in considerable numbers
then again within the city how will they exchange their productions
to secure such an exchange was as you will remember one of our principal objects when we formed them into a society and constituted a state
clearly they will buy and sell
then they will need a market place and a money token for purposes of exchange
certainly
suppose now that a husbandman or an artisan brings some production to market and he comes at a time when there is no one to exchange with him is he to leave his calling and sit idle in the market place
not at all he will find people there who seeing the want undertake the office of salesmen
in well ordered states they are commonly those who are the weakest in bodily strength and therefore of little use for any other purpose their duty is to be in the market and to give money in exchange for goods to those who desire to sell and to take money from those who desire to buy
this want then creates a class of retail traders in our state
is not retailer the term which is applied to those who sit in the market place engaged in buying and selling while those who wander from one city to another are called merchants
yes he said
and there is another class of servants who are intellectually hardly on the level of companionship still they have plenty of bodily strength for labour which accordingly they sell and are called if i do not mistake hirelings hire being the name which is given to the price of their labour
true
then hirelings will help to make up our population
yes
and now adeimantus is our state matured and perfected
i think so
where then is justice and where is injustice and in what part of the state did they spring up
probably in the dealings of these citizens with one another
i cannot imagine that they are more likely to be found any where else
i dare say that you are right in your suggestion i said we had better think the matter out and not shrink from the enquiry
let us then consider first of all what will be their way of life now that we have thus established them
will they not produce corn and wine and clothes and shoes and build houses for themselves
and when they are housed they will work in summer commonly stripped and barefoot but in winter substantially clothed and shod
they will feed on barley meal and flour of wheat baking and kneading them making noble cakes and loaves these they will serve up on a mat of reeds or on clean leaves themselves reclining the while upon beds strewn with yew or myrtle
and they and their children will feast drinking of the wine which they have made wearing garlands on their heads and hymning the praises of the gods in happy converse with one another
and they will take care that their families do not exceed their means having an eye to poverty or war
but said glaucon interposing you have not given them a relish to their meal
true i replied i had forgotten of course they must have a relish salt and olives and cheese and they will boil roots and herbs such as country people prepare for a dessert we shall give them figs and peas and beans and they will roast myrtle berries and acorns at the fire drinking in moderation
and with such a diet they may be expected to live in peace and health to a good old age and bequeath a similar life to their children after them
yes socrates he said and if you were providing for a city of pigs how else would you feed the beasts
but what would you have glaucon
i replied
why he said you should give them the ordinary conveniences of life
people who are to be comfortable are accustomed to lie on sofas and dine off tables and they should have sauces and sweets in the modern style
yes i said now i understand the question which you would have me consider is not only how a state but how a luxurious state is created and possibly there is no harm in this for in such a state we shall be more likely to see how justice and injustice originate
in my opinion the true and healthy constitution of the state is the one which i have described
but if you wish also to see a state at fever heat i have no objection
for i suspect that many will not be satisfied with the simpler way of life
they will be for adding sofas and tables and other furniture also dainties and perfumes and incense and courtesans and cakes all these not of one sort only but in every variety we must go beyond the necessaries of which i was at first speaking such as houses and clothes and shoes the arts of the painter and the embroiderer will have to be set in motion and gold and ivory and all sorts of materials must be procured
true he said
then we must enlarge our borders for the original healthy state is no longer sufficient
now will the city have to fill and swell with a multitude of callings which are not required by any natural want such as the whole tribe of hunters and actors of whom one large class have to do with forms and colours another will be the votaries of music poets and their attendant train of rhapsodists players dancers contractors also makers of divers kinds of articles including women s dresses
and we shall want more servants
will not tutors be also in request and nurses wet and dry tirewomen and barbers as well as confectioners and cooks and swineherds too who were not needed and therefore had no place in the former edition of our state but are needed now
they must not be forgotten and there will be animals of many other kinds if people eat them
certainly
and living in this way we shall have much greater need of physicians than before
much greater
and the country which was enough to support the original inhabitants will be too small now and not enough
quite true
then a slice of our neighbours land will be wanted by us for pasture and tillage and they will want a slice of ours if like ourselves they exceed the limit of necessity and give themselves up to the unlimited accumulation of wealth
that socrates will be inevitable
and so we shall go to war glaucon
shall we not
most certainly he replied
then without determining as yet whether war does good or harm thus much we may affirm that now we have discovered war to be derived from causes which are also the causes of almost all the evils in states private as well as public
undoubtedly
and our state must once more enlarge and this time the enlargement will be nothing short of a whole army which will have to go out and fight with the invaders for all that we have as well as for the things and persons whom we were describing above
why
he said are they not capable of defending themselves
no i said not if we were right in the principle which was acknowledged by all of us when we were framing the state the principle as you will remember was that one man cannot practise many arts with success
very true he said
but is not war an art
certainly
and an art requiring as much attention as shoemaking
quite true
and the shoemaker was not allowed by us to be a husbandman or a weaver or a builder in order that we might have our shoes well made but to him and to every other worker was assigned one work for which he was by nature fitted and at that he was to continue working all his life long and at no other he was not to let opportunities slip and then he would become a good workman
now nothing can be more important than that the work of a soldier should be well done
but is war an art so easily acquired that a man may be a warrior who is also a husbandman or shoemaker or other artisan although no one in the world would be a good dice or draught player who merely took up the game as a recreation and had not from his earliest years devoted himself to this and nothing else
no tools will make a man a skilled workman or master of defence nor be of any use to him who has not learned how to handle them and has never bestowed any attention upon them
how then will he who takes up a shield or other implement of war become a good fighter all in a day whether with heavy armed or any other kind of troops
yes he said the tools which would teach men their own use would be beyond price
and the higher the duties of the guardian i said the more time and skill and art and application will be needed by him
no doubt he replied
will he not also require natural aptitude for his calling
certainly
then it will be our duty to select if we can natures which are fitted for the task of guarding the city
it will
and the selection will be no easy matter i said but we must be brave and do our best
we must
is not the noble youth very like a well bred dog in respect of guarding and watching
what do you mean
i mean that both of them ought to be quick to see and swift to overtake the enemy when they see him and strong too if when they have caught him they have to fight with him
all these qualities he replied will certainly be required by them
well and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well
certainly
and is he likely to be brave who has no spirit whether horse or dog or any other animal
have you never observed how invincible and unconquerable is spirit and how the presence of it makes the soul of any creature to be absolutely fearless and indomitable
i have
then now we have a clear notion of the bodily qualities which are required in the guardian
true
and also of the mental ones his soul is to be full of spirit
yes
but are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another and with everybody else
a difficulty by no means easy to overcome he replied
whereas i said they ought to be dangerous to their enemies and gentle to their friends if not they will destroy themselves without waiting for their enemies to destroy them
true he said
what is to be done then
i said how shall we find a gentle nature which has also a great spirit for the one is the contradiction of the other
true
he will not be a good guardian who is wanting in either of these two qualities and yet the combination of them appears to be impossible and hence we must infer that to be a good guardian is impossible
i am afraid that what you say is true he replied
here feeling perplexed i began to think over what had preceded
my friend i said no wonder that we are in a perplexity for we have lost sight of the image which we had before us
what do you mean
he said
i mean to say that there do exist natures gifted with those opposite qualities
and where do you find them
many animals i replied furnish examples of them our friend the dog is a very good one you know that well bred dogs are perfectly gentle to their familiars and acquaintances and the reverse to strangers
yes i know
then there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in our finding a guardian who has a similar combination of qualities
certainly not
would not he who is fitted to be a guardian besides the spirited nature need to have the qualities of a philosopher
i do not apprehend your meaning
the trait of which i am speaking i replied may be also seen in the dog and is remarkable in the animal
what trait
why a dog whenever he sees a stranger is angry when an acquaintance he welcomes him although the one has never done him any harm nor the other any good
did this never strike you as curious
the matter never struck me before but i quite recognise the truth of your remark
and surely this instinct of the dog is very charming your dog is a true philosopher
why
why because he distinguishes the face of a friend and of an enemy only by the criterion of knowing and not knowing
and must not an animal be a lover of learning who determines what he likes and dislikes by the test of knowledge and ignorance
most assuredly
and is not the love of learning the love of wisdom which is philosophy
they are the same he replied
and may we not say confidently of man also that he who is likely to be gentle to his friends and acquaintances must by nature be a lover of wisdom and knowledge
that we may safely affirm
then he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the state will require to unite in himself philosophy and spirit and swiftness and strength
undoubtedly
then we have found the desired natures and now that we have found them how are they to be reared and educated
is not this an enquiry which may be expected to throw light on the greater enquiry which is our final end how do justice and injustice grow up in states
for we do not want either to omit what is to the point or to draw out the argument to an inconvenient length
adeimantus thought that the enquiry would be of great service to us
then i said my dear friend the task must not be given up even if somewhat long
certainly not
come then and let us pass a leisure hour in story telling and our story shall be the education of our heroes
by all means
and what shall be their education
can we find a better than the traditional sort
and this has two divisions gymnastic for the body and music for the soul
true
shall we begin education with music and go on to gymnastic afterwards
by all means
and when you speak of music do you include literature or not
i do
and literature may be either true or false
yes
and the young should be trained in both kinds and we begin with the false
i do not understand your meaning he said
you know i said that we begin by telling children stories which though not wholly destitute of truth are in the main fictitious and these stories are told them when they are not of an age to learn gymnastics
very true
that was my meaning when i said that we must teach music before gymnastics
quite right he said
you know also that the beginning is the most important part of any work especially in the case of a young and tender thing for that is the time at which the character is being formed and the desired impression is more readily taken
quite true
and shall we just carelessly allow children to hear any casual tales which may be devised by casual persons and to receive into their minds ideas for the most part the very opposite of those which we should wish them to have when they are grown up
we cannot
then the first thing will be to establish a censorship of the writers of fiction and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which is good and reject the bad and we will desire mothers and nurses to tell their children the authorised ones only
let them fashion the mind with such tales even more fondly than they mould the body with their hands but most of those which are now in use must be discarded
of what tales are you speaking
he said
you may find a model of the lesser in the greater i said for they are necessarily of the same type and there is the same spirit in both of them
very likely he replied but i do not as yet know what you would term the greater
those i said which are narrated by homer and hesiod and the rest of the poets who have ever been the great story tellers of mankind
but which stories do you mean he said and what fault do you find with them
a fault which is most serious i said the fault of telling a lie and what is more a bad lie
but when is this fault committed
whenever an erroneous representation is made of the nature of gods and heroes as when a painter paints a portrait not having the shadow of a likeness to the original
yes he said that sort of thing is certainly very blameable but what are the stories which you mean
first of all i said there was that greatest of all lies in high places which the poet told about uranus and which was a bad lie too i mean what hesiod says that uranus did and how cronus retaliated on him
the doings of cronus and the sufferings which in turn his son inflicted upon him even if they were true ought certainly not to be lightly told to young and thoughtless persons if possible they had better be buried in silence
but if there is an absolute necessity for their mention a chosen few might hear them in a mystery and they should sacrifice not a common pig but some huge and unprocurable victim and then the number of the hearers will be very few indeed
why yes said he those stories are extremely objectionable
yes adeimantus they are stories not to be repeated in our state the young man should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes he is far from doing anything outrageous and that even if he chastises his father when he does wrong in whatever manner he will only be following the example of the first and greatest among the gods
i entirely agree with you he said in my opinion those stories are quite unfit to be repeated
neither if we mean our future guardians to regard the habit of quarrelling among themselves as of all things the basest should any word be said to them of the wars in heaven and of the plots and fightings of the gods against one another for they are not true
no we shall never mention the battles of the giants or let them be embroidered on garments and we shall be silent about the innumerable other quarrels of gods and heroes with their friends and relatives
if they would only believe us we would tell them that quarrelling is unholy and that never up to this time has there been any quarrel between citizens this is what old men and old women should begin by telling children and when they grow up the poets also should be told to compose for them in a similar spirit
but the narrative of hephaestus binding here his mother or how on another occasion zeus sent him flying for taking her part when she was being beaten and all the battles of the gods in homer these tales must not be admitted into our state whether they are supposed to have an allegorical meaning or not
for a young person cannot judge what is allegorical and what is literal anything that he receives into his mind at that age is likely to become indelible and unalterable and therefore it is most important that the tales which the young first hear should be models of virtuous thoughts
there you are right he replied but if any one asks where are such models to be found and of what tales are you speaking how shall we answer him
i said to him you and i adeimantus at this moment are not poets but founders of a state now the founders of a state ought to know the general forms in which poets should cast their tales and the limits which must be observed by them but to make the tales is not their business
very true he said but what are these forms of theology which you mean
something of this kind i replied god is always to be represented as he truly is whatever be the sort of poetry epic lyric or tragic in which the representation is given
right
and is he not truly good
and must he not be represented as such
certainly
and no good thing is hurtful
no indeed
and that which is not hurtful hurts not
certainly not
and that which hurts not does no evil
no
and can that which does no evil be a cause of evil
impossible
and the good is advantageous
yes
and therefore the cause of well being
yes
it follows therefore that the good is not the cause of all things but of the good only
assuredly
then god if he be good is not the author of all things as the many assert but he is the cause of a few things only and not of most things that occur to men
for few are the goods of human life and many are the evils and the good is to be attributed to god alone of the evils the causes are to be sought elsewhere and not in him
that appears to me to be most true he said
then we must not listen to homer or to any other poet who is guilty of the folly of saying that two casks lie at the threshold of zeus full of lots one of good the other of evil lots and that he to whom zeus gives a mixture of the two sometimes meets with evil fortune at other times with good but that he to whom is given the cup of unmingled ill him wild hunger drives o er the beauteous earth
and again zeus who is the dispenser of good and evil to us
and if any one asserts that the violation of oaths and treaties which was really the work of pandarus was brought about by athene and zeus or that the strife and contention of the gods was instigated by themis and zeus he shall not have our approval neither will we allow our young men to hear the words of aeschylus that god plants guilt among men when he desires utterly to destroy a house
and if a poet writes of the sufferings of niobe the subject of the tragedy in which these iambic verses occur or of the house of pelops or of the trojan war or on any similar theme either we must not permit him to say that these are the works of god or if they are of god he must devise some explanation of them such as we are seeking he must say that god did what was just and right and they were the better for being punished but that those who are punished are miserable and that god is the author of their misery the poet is not to be permitted to say though he may say that the wicked are miserable because they require to be punished and are benefited by receiving punishment from god but that god being good is the author of evil to any one is to be strenuously denied and not to be said or sung or heard in verse or prose by any one whether old or young in any well ordered commonwealth
such a fiction is suicidal ruinous impious
i agree with you he replied and am ready to give my assent to the law
let this then be one of our rules and principles concerning the gods to which our poets and reciters will be expected to conform that god is not the author of all things but of good only
that will do he said
and what do you think of a second principle
shall i ask you whether god is a magician and of a nature to appear insidiously now in one shape and now in another sometimes himself changing and passing into many forms sometimes deceiving us with the semblance of such transformations or is he one and the same immutably fixed in his own proper image
i cannot answer you he said without more thought
well i said but if we suppose a change in anything that change must be effected either by the thing itself or by some other thing
most certainly
and things which are at their best are also least liable to be altered or discomposed for example when healthiest and strongest the human frame is least liable to be affected by meats and drinks and the plant which is in the fullest vigour also suffers least from winds or the heat of the sun or any similar causes
of course
and will not the bravest and wisest soul be least confused or deranged by any external influence
true
and the same principle as i should suppose applies to all composite things furniture houses garments when good and well made they are least altered by time and circumstances
very true
then everything which is good whether made by art or nature or both is least liable to suffer change from without
true
but surely god and the things of god are in every way perfect
of course they are
then he can hardly be compelled by external influence to take many shapes
he cannot
but may he not change and transform himself
clearly he said that must be the case if he is changed at all
and will he then change himself for the better and fairer or for the worse and more unsightly
if he change at all he can only change for the worse for we cannot suppose him to be deficient either in virtue or beauty
very true adeimantus but then would any one whether god or man desire to make himself worse
impossible
then it is impossible that god should ever be willing to change being as is supposed the fairest and best that is conceivable every god remains absolutely and for ever in his own form
that necessarily follows he said in my judgment
then i said my dear friend let none of the poets tell us that the gods taking the disguise of strangers from other lands walk up and down cities in all sorts of forms and let no one slander proteus and thetis neither let any one either in tragedy or in any other kind of poetry introduce here disguised in the likeness of a priestess asking an alms for the life giving daughters of inachus the river of argos let us have no more lies of that sort
neither must we have mothers under the influence of the poets scaring their children with a bad version of these myths telling how certain gods as they say go about by night in the likeness of so many strangers and in divers forms but let them take heed lest they make cowards of their children and at the same time speak blasphemy against the gods
heaven forbid he said
but although the gods are themselves unchangeable still by witchcraft and deception they may make us think that they appear in various forms
perhaps he replied
well but can you imagine that god will be willing to lie whether in word or deed or to put forth a phantom of himself
i cannot say he replied
do you not know i said that the true lie if such an expression may be allowed is hated of gods and men
what do you mean
he said
i mean that no one is willingly deceived in that which is the truest and highest part of himself or about the truest and highest matters there above all he is most afraid of a lie having possession of him
still he said i do not comprehend you
the reason is i replied that you attribute some profound meaning to my words but i am only saying that deception or being deceived or uninformed about the highest realities in the highest part of themselves which is the soul and in that part of them to have and to hold the lie is what mankind least like that i say is what they utterly detest
there is nothing more hateful to them
and as i was just now remarking this ignorance in the soul of him who is deceived may be called the true lie for the lie in words is only a kind of imitation and shadowy image of a previous affection of the soul not pure unadulterated falsehood
am i not right
perfectly right
the true lie is hated not only by the gods but also by men
yes
whereas the lie in words is in certain cases useful and not hateful in dealing with enemies that would be an instance or again when those whom we call our friends in a fit of madness or illusion are going to do some harm then it is useful and is a sort of medicine or preventive also in the tales of mythology of which we were just now speaking because we do not know the truth about ancient times we make falsehood as much like truth as we can and so turn it to account
very true he said
but can any of these reasons apply to god
can we suppose that he is ignorant of antiquity and therefore has recourse to invention
that would be ridiculous he said
then the lying poet has no place in our idea of god
i should say not
or perhaps he may tell a lie because he is afraid of enemies
that is inconceivable
but he may have friends who are senseless or mad
but no mad or senseless person can be a friend of god
then no motive can be imagined why god should lie
none whatever
then the superhuman and divine is absolutely incapable of falsehood
yes
then is god perfectly simple and true both in word and deed he changes not he deceives not either by sign or word by dream or waking vision
your thoughts he said are the reflection of my own
you agree with me then i said that this is the second type or form in which we should write and speak about divine things
the gods are not magicians who transform themselves neither do they deceive mankind in any way
i grant that
then although we are admirers of homer we do not admire the lying dream which zeus sends to agamemnon neither will we praise the verses of aeschylus in which thetis says that apollo at her nuptials was celebrating in song her fair progeny whose days were to be long and to know no sickness
and when he had spoken of my lot as in all things blessed of heaven he raised a note of triumph and cheered my soul
and i thought that the word of phoebus being divine and full of prophecy would not fail
and now he himself who uttered the strain he who was present at the banquet and who said this he it is who has slain my son
these are the kind of sentiments about the gods which will arouse our anger and he who utters them shall be refused a chorus neither shall we allow teachers to make use of them in the instruction of the young meaning as we do that our guardians as far as men can be should be true worshippers of the gods and like them
i entirely agree he said in these principles and promise to make them my laws
book iii
such then i said are our principles of theology some tales are to be told and others are not to be told to our disciples from their youth upwards if we mean them to honour the gods and their parents and to value friendship with one another
yes and i think that our principles are right he said
but if they are to be courageous must they not learn other lessons besides these and lessons of such a kind as will take away the fear of death
can any man be courageous who has the fear of death in him
certainly not he said
and can he be fearless of death or will he choose death in battle rather than defeat and slavery who believes the world below to be real and terrible
impossible
then we must assume a control over the narrators of this class of tales as well as over the others and beg them not simply to revile but rather to commend the world below intimating to them that their descriptions are untrue and will do harm to our future warriors
that will be our duty he said
then i said we shall have to obliterate many obnoxious passages beginning with the verses i would rather be a serf on the land of a poor and portionless man than rule over all the dead who have come to nought
we must also expunge the verse which tells us how pluto feared lest the mansions grim and squalid which the gods abhor should be seen both of mortals and immortals
and again o heavens
verily in the house of hades there is soul and ghostly form but no mind at all
again of tiresias that he alone should be wise but the other souls are flitting shades
again the soul flying from the limbs had gone to hades lamenting her fate leaving manhood and youth
again and the soul with shrilling cry passed like smoke beneath the earth
and as bats in hollow of mystic cavern whenever any of them has dropped out of the string and falls from the rock fly shrilling and cling to one another so did they with shrilling cry hold together as they moved
and we must beg homer and the other poets not to be angry if we strike out these and similar passages not because they are unpoetical or unattractive to the popular ear but because the greater the poetical charm of them the less are they meet for the ears of boys and men who are meant to be free and who should fear slavery more than death
undoubtedly
also we shall have to reject all the terrible and appalling names which describe the world below cocytus and styx ghosts under the earth and sapless shades and any similar words of which the very mention causes a shudder to pass through the inmost soul of him who hears them
i do not say that these horrible stories may not have a use of some kind but there is a danger that the nerves of our guardians may be rendered too excitable and effeminate by them
there is a real danger he said
then we must have no more of them
true
another and a nobler strain must be composed and sung by us
clearly
and shall we proceed to get rid of the weepings and wailings of famous men
they will go with the rest
but shall we be right in getting rid of them
reflect our principle is that the good man will not consider death terrible to any other good man who is his comrade
yes that is our principle
and therefore he will not sorrow for his departed friend as though he had suffered anything terrible
he will not
such an one as we further maintain is sufficient for himself and his own happiness and therefore is least in need of other men
true he said
and for this reason the loss of a son or brother or the deprivation of fortune is to him of all men least terrible
assuredly
and therefore he will be least likely to lament and will bear with the greatest equanimity any misfortune of this sort which may befall him
yes he will feel such a misfortune far less than another
then we shall be right in getting rid of the lamentations of famous men and making them over to women or to men of a baser sort that those who are being educated by us to be the defenders of their country may scorn to do the like
that will be very right
then we will once more entreat homer and the other poets not to depict achilles who is the son of a goddess first lying on his side then on his back and then on his face then starting up and sailing in a frenzy along the shores of the barren sea now taking the sooty ashes in both his hands and pouring them over his head or weeping and wailing in the various modes which homer has delineated
nor should he describe priam the kinsman of the gods as praying and beseeching rolling in the dirt calling each man loudly by his name
still more earnestly will we beg of him at all events not to introduce the gods lamenting and saying alas
my misery
alas
that i bore the bravest to my sorrow
but if he must introduce the gods at any rate let him not dare so completely to misrepresent the greatest of the gods as to make him say o heavens
with my eyes verily i behold a dear friend of mine chased round and round the city and my heart is sorrowful
or again woe is me that i am fated to have sarpedon dearest of men to me subdued at the hands of patroclus the son of menoetius
for if my sweet adeimantus our youth seriously listen to such unworthy representations of the gods instead of laughing at them as they ought hardly will any of them deem that he himself being but a man can be dishonoured by similar actions neither will he rebuke any inclination which may arise in his mind to say and do the like
and instead of having any shame or self control he will be always whining and lamenting on slight occasions
yes he said that is most true
yes i replied but that surely is what ought not to be as the argument has just proved to us and by that proof we must abide until it is disproved by a better
it ought not to be
neither ought our guardians to be given to laughter
for a fit of laughter which has been indulged to excess almost always produces a violent reaction
so i believe
then persons of worth even if only mortal men must not be represented as overcome by laughter and still less must such a representation of the gods be allowed
still less of the gods as you say he replied
then we shall not suffer such an expression to be used about the gods as that of homer when he describes how inextinguishable laughter arose among the blessed gods when they saw hephaestus bustling about the mansion
on your views we must not admit them
on my views if you like to father them on me that we must not admit them is certain
again truth should be highly valued if as we were saying a lie is useless to the gods and useful only as a medicine to men then the use of such medicines should be restricted to physicians private individuals have no business with them
clearly not he said
then if any one at all is to have the privilege of lying the rulers of the state should be the persons and they in their dealings either with enemies or with their own citizens may be allowed to lie for the public good
but nobody else should meddle with anything of the kind and although the rulers have this privilege for a private man to lie to them in return is to be deemed a more heinous fault than for the patient or the pupil of a gymnasium not to speak the truth about his own bodily illnesses to the physician or to the trainer or for a sailor not to tell the captain what is happening about the ship and the rest of the crew and how things are going with himself or his fellow sailors
most true he said
if then the ruler catches anybody beside himself lying in the state any of the craftsmen whether he be priest or physician or carpenter he will punish him for introducing a practice which is equally subversive and destructive of ship or state
most certainly he said if our idea of the state is ever carried out
in the next place our youth must be temperate
certainly
are not the chief elements of temperance speaking generally obedience to commanders and self control in sensual pleasures
true
then we shall approve such language as that of diomede in homer friend sit still and obey my word and the verses which follow the greeks marched breathing prowess .in silent awe of their leaders and other sentiments of the same kind
we shall
what of this line o heavy with wine who hast the eyes of a dog and the heart of a stag and of the words which follow
would you say that these or any similar impertinences which private individuals are supposed to address to their rulers whether in verse or prose are well or ill spoken
they are ill spoken
they may very possibly afford some amusement but they do not conduce to temperance
and therefore they are likely to do harm to our young men you would agree with me there
yes
and then again to make the wisest of men say that nothing in his opinion is more glorious than when the tables are full of bread and meat and the cup bearer carries round wine which he draws from the bowl and pours into the cups is it fit or conducive to temperance for a young man to hear such words
or the verse the saddest of fates is to die and meet destiny from hunger
what would you say again to the tale of zeus who while other gods and men were asleep and he the only person awake lay devising plans but forgot them all in a moment through his lust and was so completely overcome at the sight of here that he would not even go into the hut but wanted to lie with her on the ground declaring that he had never been in such a state of rapture before even when they first met one another without the knowledge of their parents or that other tale of how hephaestus because of similar goings on cast a chain around ares and aphrodite
indeed he said i am strongly of opinion that they ought not to hear that sort of thing
but any deeds of endurance which are done or told by famous men these they ought to see and hear as for example what is said in the verses he smote his breast and thus reproached his heart endure my heart far worse hast thou endured
certainly he said
in the next place we must not let them be receivers of gifts or lovers of money
certainly not
neither must we sing to them of gifts persuading gods and persuading reverend kings
neither is phoenix the tutor of achilles to be approved or deemed to have given his pupil good counsel when he told him that he should take the gifts of the greeks and assist them but that without a gift he should not lay aside his anger
neither will we believe or acknowledge achilles himself to have been such a lover of money that he took agamemnon s gifts or that when he had received payment he restored the dead body of hector but that without payment he was unwilling to do so
undoubtedly he said these are not sentiments which can be approved
loving homer as i do i hardly like to say that in attributing these feelings to achilles or in believing that they are truly attributed to him he is guilty of downright impiety
as little can i believe the narrative of his insolence to apollo where he says thou hast wronged me o far darter most abominable of deities
verily i would be even with thee if i had only the power or his insubordination to the river god on whose divinity he is ready to lay hands or his offering to the dead patroclus of his own hair which had been previously dedicated to the other river god spercheius and that he actually performed this vow or that he dragged hector round the tomb of patroclus and slaughtered the captives at the pyre of all this i cannot believe that he was guilty any more than i can allow our citizens to believe that he the wise cheiron s pupil the son of a goddess and of peleus who was the gentlest of men and third in descent from zeus was so disordered in his wits as to be at one time the slave of two seemingly inconsistent passions meanness not untainted by avarice combined with overweening contempt of gods and men
you are quite right he replied
and let us equally refuse to believe or allow to be repeated the tale of theseus son of poseidon or of peirithous son of zeus going forth as they did to perpetrate a horrid rape or of any other hero or son of a god daring to do such impious and dreadful things as they falsely ascribe to them in our day and let us further compel the poets to declare either that these acts were not done by them or that they were not the sons of gods both in the same breath they shall not be permitted to affirm
we will not have them trying to persuade our youth that the gods are the authors of evil and that heroes are no better than men sentiments which as we were saying are neither pious nor true for we have already proved that evil cannot come from the gods
assuredly not
and further they are likely to have a bad effect on those who hear them for everybody will begin to excuse his own vices when he is convinced that similar wickednesses are always being perpetrated by the kindred of the gods the relatives of zeus whose ancestral altar the altar of zeus is aloft in air on the peak of ida and who have the blood of deities yet flowing in their veins
and therefore let us put an end to such tales lest they engender laxity of morals among the young
by all means he replied
but now that we are determining what classes of subjects are or are not to be spoken of let us see whether any have been omitted by us
the manner in which gods and demigods and heroes and the world below should be treated has been already laid down
very true
and what shall we say about men
that is clearly the remaining portion of our subject
clearly so
but we are not in a condition to answer this question at present my friend
why not
because if i am not mistaken we shall have to say that about men poets and story tellers are guilty of making the gravest misstatements when they tell us that wicked men are often happy and the good miserable and that injustice is profitable when undetected but that justice is a man s own loss and another s gain these things we shall forbid them to utter and command them to sing and say the opposite
to be sure we shall he replied
but if you admit that i am right in this then i shall maintain that you have implied the principle for which we have been all along contending
i grant the truth of your inference
that such things are or are not to be said about men is a question which we cannot determine until we have discovered what justice is and how naturally advantageous to the possessor whether he seem to be just or not
most true he said
enough of the subjects of poetry let us now speak of the style and when this has been considered both matter and manner will have been completely treated
i do not understand what you mean said adeimantus
then i must make you understand and perhaps i may be more intelligible if i put the matter in this way
you are aware i suppose that all mythology and poetry is a narration of events either past present or to come
certainly he replied
and narration may be either simple narration or imitation or a union of the two
that again he said i do not quite understand
i fear that i must be a ridiculous teacher when i have so much difficulty in making myself apprehended
like a bad speaker therefore i will not take the whole of the subject but will break a piece off in illustration of my meaning
you know the first lines of the iliad in which the poet says that chryses prayed agamemnon to release his daughter and that agamemnon flew into a passion with him whereupon chryses failing of his object invoked the anger of the god against the achaeans
now as far as these lines and he prayed all the greeks but especially the two sons of atreus the chiefs of the people the poet is speaking in his own person he never leads us to suppose that he is any one else
but in what follows he takes the person of chryses and then he does all that he can to make us believe that the speaker is not homer but the aged priest himself
and in this double form he has cast the entire narrative of the events which occurred at troy and in ithaca and throughout the odyssey
yes
and a narrative it remains both in the speeches which the poet recites from time to time and in the intermediate passages
quite true
but when the poet speaks in the person of another may we not say that he assimilates his style to that of the person who as he informs you is going to speak
certainly
and this assimilation of himself to another either by the use of voice or gesture is the imitation of the person whose character he assumes
of course
then in this case the narrative of the poet may be said to proceed by way of imitation
very true
or if the poet everywhere appears and never conceals himself then again the imitation is dropped and his poetry becomes simple narration
however in order that i may make my meaning quite clear and that you may no more say i don t understand i will show how the change might be effected
if homer had said the priest came having his daughter s ransom in his hands supplicating the achaeans and above all the kings and then if instead of speaking in the person of chryses he had continued in his own person the words would have been not imitation but simple narration
the passage would have run as follows the priest came and prayed the gods on behalf of the greeks that they might capture troy and return safely home but begged that they would give him back his daughter and take the ransom which he brought and respect the god
thus he spoke and the other greeks revered the priest and assented
but agamemnon was wroth and bade him depart and not come again lest the staff and chaplets of the god should be of no avail to him the daughter of chryses should not be released he said she should grow old with him in argos
and then he told him to go away and not to provoke him if he intended to get home unscathed
and the old man went away in fear and silence and when he had left the camp he called upon apollo by his many names reminding him of everything which he had done pleasing to him whether in building his temples or in offering sacrifice and praying that his good deeds might be returned to him and that the achaeans might expiate his tears by the arrows of the god and so on
in this way the whole becomes simple narrative
i understand he said
or you may suppose the opposite case that the intermediate passages are omitted and the dialogue only left
that also he said i understand you mean for example as in tragedy
you have conceived my meaning perfectly and if i mistake not what you failed to apprehend before is now made clear to you that poetry and mythology are in some cases wholly imitative instances of this are supplied by tragedy and comedy there is likewise the opposite style in which the poet is the only speaker of this the dithyramb affords the best example and the combination of both is found in epic and in several other styles of poetry
do i take you with me
yes he said i see now what you meant
i will ask you to remember also what i began by saying that we had done with the subject and might proceed to the style
yes i remember
in saying this i intended to imply that we must come to an understanding about the mimetic art whether the poets in narrating their stories are to be allowed by us to imitate and if so whether in whole or in part and if the latter in what parts or should all imitation be prohibited
you mean i suspect to ask whether tragedy and comedy shall be admitted into our state
yes i said but there may be more than this in question i really do not know as yet but whither the argument may blow thither we go
and go we will he said
then adeimantus let me ask you whether our guardians ought to be imitators or rather has not this question been decided by the rule already laid down that one man can only do one thing well and not many and that if he attempt many he will altogether fail of gaining much reputation in any
certainly
and this is equally true of imitation no one man can imitate many things as well as he would imitate a single one
he cannot
then the same person will hardly be able to play a serious part in life and at the same time to be an imitator and imitate many other parts as well for even when two species of imitation are nearly allied the same persons cannot succeed in both as for example the writers of tragedy and comedy did you not just now call them imitations
yes i did and you are right in thinking that the same persons cannot succeed in both
any more than they can be rhapsodists and actors at once
true
neither are comic and tragic actors the same yet all these things are but imitations
they are so
and human nature adeimantus appears to have been coined into yet smaller pieces and to be as incapable of imitating many things well as of performing well the actions of which the imitations are copies
quite true he replied
if then we adhere to our original notion and bear in mind that our guardians setting aside every other business are to dedicate themselves wholly to the maintenance of freedom in the state making this their craft and engaging in no work which does not bear on this end they ought not to practise or imitate anything else if they imitate at all they should imitate from youth upward only those characters which are suitable to their profession the courageous temperate holy free and the like but they should not depict or be skilful at imitating any kind of illiberality or baseness lest from imitation they should come to be what they imitate
did you never observe how imitations beginning in early youth and continuing far into life at length grow into habits and become a second nature affecting body voice and mind
yes certainly he said
then i said we will not allow those for whom we profess a care and of whom we say that they ought to be good men to imitate a woman whether young or old quarrelling with her husband or striving and vaunting against the gods in conceit of her happiness or when she is in affliction or sorrow or weeping and certainly not one who is in sickness love or labour
very right he said
neither must they represent slaves male or female performing the offices of slaves
they must not
and surely not bad men whether cowards or any others who do the reverse of what we have just been prescribing who scold or mock or revile one another in drink or out of drink or who in any other manner sin against themselves and their neighbours in word or deed as the manner of such is
neither should they be trained to imitate the action or speech of men or women who are mad or bad for madness like vice is to be known but not to be practised or imitated
very true he replied
neither may they imitate smiths or other artificers or oarsmen or boatswains or the like
how can they he said when they are not allowed to apply their minds to the callings of any of these
nor may they imitate the neighing of horses the bellowing of bulls the murmur of rivers and roll of the ocean thunder and all that sort of thing
nay he said if madness be forbidden neither may they copy the behaviour of madmen
you mean i said if i understand you aright that there is one sort of narrative style which may be employed by a truly good man when he has anything to say and that another sort will be used by a man of an opposite character and education
and which are these two sorts
he asked
suppose i answered that a just and good man in the course of a narration comes on some saying or action of another good man i should imagine that he will like to personate him and will not be ashamed of this sort of imitation he will be most ready to play the part of the good man when he is acting firmly and wisely in a less degree when he is overtaken by illness or love or drink or has met with any other disaster
but when he comes to a character which is unworthy of him he will not make a study of that he will disdain such a person and will assume his likeness if at all for a moment only when he is performing some good action at other times he will be ashamed to play a part which he has never practised nor will he like to fashion and frame himself after the baser models he feels the employment of such an art unless in jest to be beneath him and his mind revolts at it
so i should expect he replied
then he will adopt a mode of narration such as we have illustrated out of homer that is to say his style will be both imitative and narrative but there will be very little of the former and a great deal of the latter
do you agree
certainly he said that is the model which such a speaker must necessarily take
but there is another sort of character who will narrate anything and the worse he is the more unscrupulous he will be nothing will be too bad for him and he will be ready to imitate anything not as a joke but in right good earnest and before a large company
as i was just now saying he will attempt to represent the roll of thunder the noise of wind and hail or the creaking of wheels and pulleys and the various sounds of flutes pipes trumpets and all sorts of instruments he will bark like a dog bleat like a sheep or crow like a cock his entire art will consist in imitation of voice and gesture and there will be very little narration
that he said will be his mode of speaking
these then are the two kinds of style
yes
and you would agree with me in saying that one of them is simple and has but slight changes and if the harmony and rhythm are also chosen for their simplicity the result is that the speaker if he speaks correctly is always pretty much the same in style and he will keep within the limits of a single harmony and in like manner he will make use of nearly the same rhythm
that is quite true he said
whereas the other requires all sorts of harmonies and all sorts of rhythms if the music and the style are to correspond because the style has all sorts of changes
that is also perfectly true he replied
and do not the two styles or the mixture of the two comprehend all poetry and every form of expression in words
no one can say anything except in one or other of them or in both together
they include all he said
and shall we receive into our state all the three styles or one only of the two unmixed styles
or would you include the mixed
i should prefer only to admit the pure imitator of virtue
yes i said adeimantus but the mixed style is also very charming and indeed the pantomimic which is the opposite of the one chosen by you is the most popular style with children and their attendants and with the world in general
i do not deny it
but i suppose you would argue that such a style is unsuitable to our state in which human nature is not twofold or manifold for one man plays one part only
yes quite unsuitable
and this is the reason why in our state and in our state only we shall find a shoemaker to be a shoemaker and not a pilot also and a husbandman to be a husbandman and not a dicast also and a soldier a soldier and not a trader also and the same throughout
true he said
and therefore when any one of these pantomimic gentlemen who are so clever that they can imitate anything comes to us and makes a proposal to exhibit himself and his poetry we will fall down and worship him as a sweet and holy and wonderful being but we must also inform him that in our state such as he are not permitted to exist the law will not allow them
and so when we have anointed him with myrrh and set a garland of wool upon his head we shall send him away to another city
for we mean to employ for our souls health the rougher and severer poet or story teller who will imitate the style of the virtuous only and will follow those models which we prescribed at first when we began the education of our soldiers
we certainly will he said if we have the power
then now my friend i said that part of music or literary education which relates to the story or myth may be considered to be finished for the matter and manner have both been discussed
i think so too he said
next in order will follow melody and song
that is obvious
every one can see already what we ought to say about them if we are to be consistent with ourselves
i fear said glaucon laughing that the word every one hardly includes me for i cannot at the moment say what they should be though i may guess
at any rate you can tell that a song or ode has three parts the words the melody and the rhythm that degree of knowledge i may presuppose
yes he said so much as that you may
and as for the words there will surely be no difference between words which are and which are not set to music both will conform to the same laws and these have been already determined by us
yes
and the melody and rhythm will depend upon the words
certainly
we were saying when we spoke of the subject matter that we had no need of lamentation and strains of sorrow
true
and which are the harmonies expressive of sorrow
you are musical and can tell me
the harmonies which you mean are the mixed or tenor lydian and the full toned or bass lydian and such like
these then i said must be banished even to women who have a character to maintain they are of no use and much less to men
certainly
in the next place drunkenness and softness and indolence are utterly unbecoming the character of our guardians
utterly unbecoming
and which are the soft or drinking harmonies
the ionian he replied and the lydian they are termed relaxed
well and are these of any military use
quite the reverse he replied and if so the dorian and the phrygian are the only ones which you have left
i answered of the harmonies i know nothing but i want to have one warlike to sound the note or accent which a brave man utters in the hour of danger and stern resolve or when his cause is failing and he is going to wounds or death or is overtaken by some other evil and at every such crisis meets the blows of fortune with firm step and a determination to endure and another to be used by him in times of peace and freedom of action when there is no pressure of necessity and he is seeking to persuade god by prayer or man by instruction and admonition or on the other hand when he is expressing his willingness to yield to persuasion or entreaty or admonition and which represents him when by prudent conduct he has attained his end not carried away by his success but acting moderately and wisely under the circumstances and acquiescing in the event
these two harmonies i ask you to leave the strain of necessity and the strain of freedom the strain of the unfortunate and the strain of the fortunate the strain of courage and the strain of temperance these i say leave
and these he replied are the dorian and phrygian harmonies of which i was just now speaking
then i said if these and these only are to be used in our songs and melodies we shall not want multiplicity of notes or a panharmonic scale
i suppose not
then we shall not maintain the artificers of lyres with three corners and complex scales or the makers of any other many stringed curiously harmonised instruments
certainly not
but what do you say to flute makers and flute players
would you admit them into our state when you reflect that in this composite use of harmony the flute is worse than all the stringed instruments put together even the panharmonic music is only an imitation of the flute
clearly not
there remain then only the lyre and the harp for use in the city and the shepherds may have a pipe in the country
that is surely the conclusion to be drawn from the argument
the preferring of apollo and his instruments to marsyas and his instruments is not at all strange i said
not at all he replied
and so by the dog of egypt we have been unconsciously purging the state which not long ago we termed luxurious
and we have done wisely he replied
then let us now finish the purgation i said
next in order to harmonies rhythms will naturally follow and they should be subject to the same rules for we ought not to seek out complex systems of metre or metres of every kind but rather to discover what rhythms are the expressions of a courageous and harmonious life and when we have found them we shall adapt the foot and the melody to words having a like spirit not the words to the foot and melody
to say what these rhythms are will be your duty you must teach me them as you have already taught me the harmonies
but indeed he replied i cannot tell you
i only know that there are some three principles of rhythm out of which metrical systems are framed just as in sounds there are four notes out of which all the harmonies are composed that is an observation which i have made
but of what sort of lives they are severally the imitations i am unable to say
then i said we must take damon into our counsels and he will tell us what rhythms are expressive of meanness or insolence or fury or other unworthiness and what are to be reserved for the expression of opposite feelings
and i think that i have an indistinct recollection of his mentioning a complex cretic rhythm also a dactylic or heroic and he arranged them in some manner which i do not quite understand making the rhythms equal in the rise and fall of the foot long and short alternating and unless i am mistaken he spoke of an iambic as well as of a trochaic rhythm and assigned to them short and long quantities
also in some cases he appeared to praise or censure the movement of the foot quite as much as the rhythm or perhaps a combination of the two for i am not certain what he meant
these matters however as i was saying had better be referred to damon himself for the analysis of the subject would be difficult you know
rather so i should say
but there is no difficulty in seeing that grace or the absence of grace is an effect of good or bad rhythm
none at all
and also that good and bad rhythm naturally assimilate to a good and bad style and that harmony and discord in like manner follow style for our principle is that rhythm and harmony are regulated by the words and not the words by them
just so he said they should follow the words
and will not the words and the character of the style depend on the temper of the soul
yes
and everything else on the style
yes
then beauty of style and harmony and grace and good rhythm depend on simplicity i mean the true simplicity of a rightly and nobly ordered mind and character not that other simplicity which is only an euphemism for folly
very true he replied
and if our youth are to do their work in life must they not make these graces and harmonies their perpetual aim
they must
and surely the art of the painter and every other creative and constructive art are full of them weaving embroidery architecture and every kind of manufacture also nature animal and vegetable in all of them there is grace or the absence of grace
and ugliness and discord and inharmonious motion are nearly allied to ill words and ill nature as grace and harmony are the twin sisters of goodness and virtue and bear their likeness
that is quite true he said
but shall our superintendence go no further and are the poets only to be required by us to express the image of the good in their works on pain if they do anything else of expulsion from our state
or is the same control to be extended to other artists and are they also to be prohibited from exhibiting the opposite forms of vice and intemperance and meanness and indecency in sculpture and building and the other creative arts and is he who cannot conform to this rule of ours to be prevented from practising his art in our state lest the taste of our citizens be corrupted by him
we would not have our guardians grow up amid images of moral deformity as in some noxious pasture and there browse and feed upon many a baneful herb and flower day by day little by little until they silently gather a festering mass of corruption in their own soul
let our artists rather be those who are gifted to discern the true nature of the beautiful and graceful then will our youth dwell in a land of health amid fair sights and sounds and receive the good in everything and beauty the effluence of fair works shall flow into the eye and ear like a health giving breeze from a purer region and insensibly draw the soul from earliest years into likeness and sympathy with the beauty of reason
there can be no nobler training than that he replied
and therefore i said glaucon musical training is a more potent instrument than any other because rhythm and harmony find their way into the inward places of the soul on which they mightily fasten imparting grace and making the soul of him who is rightly educated graceful or of him who is ill educated ungraceful and also because he who has received this true education of the inner being will most shrewdly perceive omissions or faults in art and nature and with a true taste while he praises and rejoices over and receives into his soul the good and becomes noble and good he will justly blame and hate the bad now in the days of his youth even before he is able to know the reason why and when reason comes he will recognise and salute the friend with whom his education has made him long familiar
yes he said i quite agree with you in thinking that our youth should be trained in music and on the grounds which you mention
just as in learning to read i said we were satisfied when we knew the letters of the alphabet which are very few in all their recurring sizes and combinations not slighting them as unimportant whether they occupy a space large or small but everywhere eager to make them out and not thinking ourselves perfect in the art of reading until we recognise them wherever they are found true or as we recognise the reflection of letters in the water or in a mirror only when we know the letters themselves the same art and study giving us the knowledge of both exactly even so as i maintain neither we nor our guardians whom we have to educate can ever become musical until we and they know the essential forms of temperance courage liberality magnificence and their kindred as well as the contrary forms in all their combinations and can recognise them and their images wherever they are found not slighting them either in small things or great but believing them all to be within the sphere of one art and study
most assuredly
and when a beautiful soul harmonizes with a beautiful form and the two are cast in one mould that will be the fairest of sights to him who has an eye to see it
the fairest indeed
and the fairest is also the loveliest
that may be assumed
and the man who has the spirit of harmony will be most in love with the loveliest but he will not love him who is of an inharmonious soul
that is true he replied if the deficiency be in his soul but if there be any merely bodily defect in another he will be patient of it and will love all the same
i perceive i said that you have or have had experiences of this sort and i agree
but let me ask you another question has excess of pleasure any affinity to temperance
how can that be
he replied pleasure deprives a man of the use of his faculties quite as much as pain
or any affinity to virtue in general
none whatever
any affinity to wantonness and intemperance
yes the greatest
and is there any greater or keener pleasure than that of sensual love
no nor a madder
whereas true love is a love of beauty and order temperate and harmonious
quite true he said
then no intemperance or madness should be allowed to approach true love
certainly not
then mad or intemperate pleasure must never be allowed to come near the lover and his beloved neither of them can have any part in it if their love is of the right sort
no indeed socrates it must never come near them
then i suppose that in the city which we are founding you would make a law to the effect that a friend should use no other familiarity to his love than a father would use to his son and then only for a noble purpose and he must first have the other s consent and this rule is to limit him in all his intercourse and he is never to be seen going further or if he exceeds he is to be deemed guilty of coarseness and bad taste
i quite agree he said
thus much of music which makes a fair ending for what should be the end of music if not the love of beauty
i agree he said
after music comes gymnastic in which our youth are next to be trained
certainly
gymnastic as well as music should begin in early years the training in it should be careful and should continue through life
now my belief is and this is a matter upon which i should like to have your opinion in confirmation of my own but my own belief is not that the good body by any bodily excellence improves the soul but on the contrary that the good soul by her own excellence improves the body as far as this may be possible
what do you say
yes i agree
then to the mind when adequately trained we shall be right in handing over the more particular care of the body and in order to avoid prolixity we will now only give the general outlines of the subject
very good
that they must abstain from intoxication has been already remarked by us for of all persons a guardian should be the last to get drunk and not know where in the world he is
yes he said that a guardian should require another guardian to take care of him is ridiculous indeed
but next what shall we say of their food for the men are in training for the great contest of all are they not
yes he said
and will the habit of body of our ordinary athletes be suited to them
why not
i am afraid i said that a habit of body such as they have is but a sleepy sort of thing and rather perilous to health
do you not observe that these athletes sleep away their lives and are liable to most dangerous illnesses if they depart in ever so slight a degree from their customary regimen
yes i do
then i said a finer sort of training will be required for our warrior athletes who are to be like wakeful dogs and to see and hear with the utmost keenness amid the many changes of water and also of food of summer heat and winter cold which they will have to endure when on a campaign they must not be liable to break down in health
that is my view
the really excellent gymnastic is twin sister of that simple music which we were just now describing
how so
why i conceive that there is a gymnastic which like our music is simple and good and especially the military gymnastic
what do you mean
my meaning may be learned from homer he you know feeds his heroes at their feasts when they are campaigning on soldiers fare they have no fish although they are on the shores of the hellespont and they are not allowed boiled meats but only roast which is the food most convenient for soldiers requiring only that they should light a fire and not involving the trouble of carrying about pots and pans
true
and i can hardly be mistaken in saying that sweet sauces are nowhere mentioned in homer
in proscribing them however he is not singular all professional athletes are well aware that a man who is to be in good condition should take nothing of the kind
yes he said and knowing this they are quite right in not taking them
then you would not approve of syracusan dinners and the refinements of sicilian cookery
i think not
nor if a man is to be in condition would you allow him to have a corinthian girl as his fair friend
certainly not
neither would you approve of the delicacies as they are thought of athenian confectionary
certainly not
all such feeding and living may be rightly compared by us to melody and song composed in the panharmonic style and in all the rhythms
exactly
there complexity engendered licence and here disease whereas simplicity in music was the parent of temperance in the soul and simplicity in gymnastic of health in the body
most true he said
but when intemperance and diseases multiply in a state halls of justice and medicine are always being opened and the arts of the doctor and the lawyer give themselves airs finding how keen is the interest which not only the slaves but the freemen of a city take about them
of course
and yet what greater proof can there be of a bad and disgraceful state of education than this that not only artisans and the meaner sort of people need the skill of first rate physicians and judges but also those who would profess to have had a liberal education
is it not disgraceful and a great sign of want of good breeding that a man should have to go abroad for his law and physic because he has none of his own at home and must therefore surrender himself into the hands of other men whom he makes lords and judges over him
of all things he said the most disgraceful
would you say most i replied when you consider that there is a further stage of the evil in which a man is not only a life long litigant passing all his days in the courts either as plaintiff or defendant but is actually led by his bad taste to pride himself on his litigiousness he imagines that he is a master in dishonesty able to take every crooked turn and wriggle into and out of every hole bending like a withy and getting out of the way of justice and all for what
in order to gain small points not worth mentioning he not knowing that so to order his life as to be able to do without a napping judge is a far higher and nobler sort of thing
is not that still more disgraceful
yes he said that is still more disgraceful
well i said and to require the help of medicine not when a wound has to be cured or on occasion of an epidemic but just because by indolence and a habit of life such as we have been describing men fill themselves with waters and winds as if their bodies were a marsh compelling the ingenious sons of asclepius to find more names for diseases such as flatulence and catarrh is not this too a disgrace
yes he said they do certainly give very strange and newfangled names to diseases
yes i said and i do not believe that there were any such diseases in the days of asclepius and this i infer from the circumstance that the hero eurypylus after he has been wounded in homer drinks a posset of pramnian wine well besprinkled with barley meal and grated cheese which are certainly inflammatory and yet the sons of asclepius who were at the trojan war do not blame the damsel who gives him the drink or rebuke patroclus who is treating his case
well he said that was surely an extraordinary drink to be given to a person in his condition
not so extraordinary i replied if you bear in mind that in former days as is commonly said before the time of herodicus the guild of asclepius did not practise our present system of medicine which may be said to educate diseases
but herodicus being a trainer and himself of a sickly constitution by a combination of training and doctoring found out a way of torturing first and chiefly himself and secondly the rest of the world
how was that
he said
by the invention of lingering death for he had a mortal disease which he perpetually tended and as recovery was out of the question he passed his entire life as a valetudinarian he could do nothing but attend upon himself and he was in constant torment whenever he departed in anything from his usual regimen and so dying hard by the help of science he struggled on to old age
a rare reward of his skill
yes i said a reward which a man might fairly expect who never understood that if asclepius did not instruct his descendants in valetudinarian arts the omission arose not from ignorance or inexperience of such a branch of medicine but because he knew that in all well ordered states every individual has an occupation to which he must attend and has therefore no leisure to spend in continually being ill
this we remark in the case of the artisan but ludicrously enough do not apply the same rule to people of the richer sort
how do you mean
he said
i mean this when a carpenter is ill he asks the physician for a rough and ready cure an emetic or a purge or a cautery or the knife these are his remedies
and if some one prescribes for him a course of dietetics and tells him that he must swathe and swaddle his head and all that sort of thing he replies at once that he has no time to be ill and that he sees no good in a life which is spent in nursing his disease to the neglect of his customary employment and therefore bidding good bye to this sort of physician he resumes his ordinary habits and either gets well and lives and does his business or if his constitution fails he dies and has no more trouble
yes he said and a man in his condition of life ought to use the art of medicine thus far only
has he not i said an occupation and what profit would there be in his life if he were deprived of his occupation
quite true he said
but with the rich man this is otherwise of him we do not say that he has any specially appointed work which he must perform if he would live
he is generally supposed to have nothing to do
then you never heard of the saying of phocylides that as soon as a man has a livelihood he should practise virtue
nay he said i think that he had better begin somewhat sooner
let us not have a dispute with him about this i said but rather ask ourselves is the practice of virtue obligatory on the rich man or can he live without it
and if obligatory on him then let us raise a further question whether this dieting of disorders which is an impediment to the application of the mind in carpentering and the mechanical arts does not equally stand in the way of the sentiment of phocylides
of that he replied there can be no doubt such excessive care of the body when carried beyond the rules of gymnastic is most inimical to the practice of virtue
yes indeed i replied and equally incompatible with the management of a house an army or an office of state and what is most important of all irreconcileable with any kind of study or thought or self reflection there is a constant suspicion that headache and giddiness are to be ascribed to philosophy and hence all practising or making trial of virtue in the higher sense is absolutely stopped for a man is always fancying that he is being made ill and is in constant anxiety about the state of his body
yes likely enough
and therefore our politic asclepius may be supposed to have exhibited the power of his art only to persons who being generally of healthy constitution and habits of life had a definite ailment such as these he cured by purges and operations and bade them live as usual herein consulting the interests of the state but bodies which disease had penetrated through and through he would not have attempted to cure by gradual processes of evacuation and infusion he did not want to lengthen out good for nothing lives or to have weak fathers begetting weaker sons if a man was not able to live in the ordinary way he had no business to cure him for such a cure would have been of no use either to himself or to the state
then he said you regard asclepius as a statesman
clearly and his character is further illustrated by his sons
note that they were heroes in the days of old and practised the medicines of which i am speaking at the siege of troy you will remember how when pandarus wounded menelaus they sucked the blood out of the wound and sprinkled soothing remedies but they never prescribed what the patient was afterwards to eat or drink in the case of menelaus any more than in the case of eurypylus the remedies as they conceived were enough to heal any man who before he was wounded was healthy and regular in his habits and even though he did happen to drink a posset of pramnian wine he might get well all the same
but they would have nothing to do with unhealthy and intemperate subjects whose lives were of no use either to themselves or others the art of medicine was not designed for their good and though they were as rich as midas the sons of asclepius would have declined to attend them
they were very acute persons those sons of asclepius
naturally so i replied
nevertheless the tragedians and pindar disobeying our behests although they acknowledge that asclepius was the son of apollo say also that he was bribed into healing a rich man who was at the point of death and for this reason he was struck by lightning
but we in accordance with the principle already affirmed by us will not believe them when they tell us both if he was the son of a god we maintain that he was not avaricious or if he was avaricious he was not the son of a god
all that socrates is excellent but i should like to put a question to you ought there not to be good physicians in a state and are not the best those who have treated the greatest number of constitutions good and bad
and are not the best judges in like manner those who are acquainted with all sorts of moral natures
yes i said i too would have good judges and good physicians
but do you know whom i think good
will you tell me
i will if i can
let me however note that in the same question you join two things which are not the same
how so
he asked
why i said you join physicians and judges
now the most skilful physicians are those who from their youth upwards have combined with the knowledge of their art the greatest experience of disease they had better not be robust in health and should have had all manner of diseases in their own persons
for the body as i conceive is not the instrument with which they cure the body in that case we could not allow them ever to be or to have been sickly but they cure the body with the mind and the mind which has become and is sick can cure nothing
that is very true he said
but with the judge it is otherwise since he governs mind by mind he ought not therefore to have been trained among vicious minds and to have associated with them from youth upwards and to have gone through the whole calendar of crime only in order that he may quickly infer the crimes of others as he might their bodily diseases from his own self consciousness the honourable mind which is to form a healthy judgment should have had no experience or contamination of evil habits when young
and this is the reason why in youth good men often appear to be simple and are easily practised upon by the dishonest because they have no examples of what evil is in their own souls
yes he said they are far too apt to be deceived
therefore i said the judge should not be young he should have learned to know evil not from his own soul but from late and long observation of the nature of evil in others knowledge should be his guide not personal experience
yes he said that is the ideal of a judge
yes i replied and he will be a good man for he is good who has a good soul
but the cunning and suspicious nature of which we spoke he who has committed many crimes and fancies himself to be a master in wickedness when he is amongst his fellows is wonderful in the precautions which he takes because he judges of them by himself but when he gets into the company of men of virtue who have the experience of age he appears to be a fool again owing to his unseasonable suspicions he cannot recognise an honest man because he has no pattern of honesty in himself at the same time as the bad are more numerous than the good and he meets with them oftener he thinks himself and is by others thought to be rather wise than foolish
most true he said
then the good and wise judge whom we are seeking is not this man but the other for vice cannot know virtue too but a virtuous nature educated by time will acquire a knowledge both of virtue and vice the virtuous and not the vicious man has wisdom in my opinion
and in mine also
this is the sort of medicine and this is the sort of law which you will sanction in your state
they will minister to better natures giving health both of soul and of body but those who are diseased in their bodies they will leave to die and the corrupt and incurable souls they will put an end to themselves
that is clearly the best thing both for the patients and for the state
and thus our youth having been educated only in that simple music which as we said inspires temperance will be reluctant to go to law
clearly
and the musician who keeping to the same track is content to practise the simple gymnastic will have nothing to do with medicine unless in some extreme case
that i quite believe
the very exercises and tolls which he undergoes are intended to stimulate the spirited element of his nature and not to increase his strength he will not like common athletes use exercise and regimen to develope his muscles
very right he said
neither are the two arts of music and gymnastic really designed as is often supposed the one for the training of the soul the other for the training of the body
what then is the real object of them
i believe i said that the teachers of both have in view chiefly the improvement of the soul
how can that be
he asked
did you never observe i said the effect on the mind itself of exclusive devotion to gymnastic or the opposite effect of an exclusive devotion to music
in what way shown
he said
the one producing a temper of hardness and ferocity the other of softness and effeminacy i replied
yes he said i am quite aware that the mere athlete becomes too much of a savage and that the mere musician is melted and softened beyond what is good for him
yet surely i said this ferocity only comes from spirit which if rightly educated would give courage but if too much intensified is liable to become hard and brutal
that i quite think
on the other hand the philosopher will have the quality of gentleness
and this also when too much indulged will turn to softness but if educated rightly will be gentle and moderate
true
and in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities
assuredly
and both should be in harmony
beyond question
and the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous
yes
and the inharmonious is cowardly and boorish
very true
and when a man allows music to play upon him and to pour into his soul through the funnel of his ears those sweet and soft and melancholy airs of which we were just now speaking and his whole life is passed in warbling and the delights of song in the first stage of the process the passion or spirit which is in him is tempered like iron and made useful instead of brittle and useless
but if he carries on the softening and soothing process in the next stage he begins to melt and waste until he has wasted away his spirit and cut out the sinews of his soul and he becomes a feeble warrior
very true
if the element of spirit is naturally weak in him the change is speedily accomplished but if he have a good deal then the power of music weakening the spirit renders him excitable on the least provocation he flames up at once and is speedily extinguished instead of having spirit he grows irritable and passionate and is quite impracticable
exactly
and so in gymnastics if a man takes violent exercise and is a great feeder and the reverse of a great student of music and philosophy at first the high condition of his body fills him with pride and spirit and he becomes twice the man that he was
certainly
and what happens
if he do nothing else and holds no converse with the muses does not even that intelligence which there may be in him having no taste of any sort of learning or enquiry or thought or culture grow feeble and dull and blind his mind never waking up or receiving nourishment and his senses not being purged of their mists
true he said
and he ends by becoming a hater of philosophy uncivilized never using the weapon of persuasion he is like a wild beast all violence and fierceness and knows no other way of dealing and he lives in all ignorance and evil conditions and has no sense of propriety and grace
that is quite true he said
and as there are two principles of human nature one the spirited and the other the philosophical some god as i should say has given mankind two arts answering to them in order that these two principles may be relaxed or drawn tighter until they are duly harmonized
that appears to be the intention
and he who mingles music with gymnastic in the fairest proportions and best attempers them to the soul may be rightly called the true musician and harmonist in a far higher sense than the tuner of the strings
you are quite right socrates
and such a presiding genius will be always required in our state if the government is to last
yes he will be absolutely necessary
such then are our principles of nurture and education where would be the use of going into further details about the dances of our citizens or about their hunting and coursing their gymnastic and equestrian contests
for these all follow the general principle and having found that we shall have no difficulty in discovering them
i dare say that there will be no difficulty
very good i said then what is the next question
must we not ask who are to be rulers and who subjects
certainly
there can be no doubt that the elder must rule the younger
clearly
and that the best of these must rule
that is also clear
now are not the best husbandmen those who are most devoted to husbandry
yes
and as we are to have the best of guardians for our city must they not be those who have most the character of guardians
yes
and to this end they ought to be wise and efficient and to have a special care of the state
true
and a man will be most likely to care about that which he loves
to be sure
and he will be most likely to love that which he regards as having the same interests with himself and that of which the good or evil fortune is supposed by him at any time most to affect his own
very true he replied
then there must be a selection
let us note among the guardians those who in their whole life show the greatest eagerness to do what is for the good of their country and the greatest repugnance to do what is against her interests
those are the right men
and they will have to be watched at every age in order that we may see whether they preserve their resolution and never under the influence either of force or enchantment forget or cast off their sense of duty to the state
how cast off
he said
i will explain to you i replied
a resolution may go out of a man s mind either with his will or against his will with his will when he gets rid of a falsehood and learns better against his will whenever he is deprived of a truth
i understand he said the willing loss of a resolution the meaning of the unwilling i have yet to learn
why i said do you not see that men are unwillingly deprived of good and willingly of evil
is not to have lost the truth an evil and to possess the truth a good
and you would agree that to conceive things as they are is to possess the truth
yes he replied i agree with you in thinking that mankind are deprived of truth against their will
and is not this involuntary deprivation caused either by theft or force or enchantment
still he replied i do not understand you
i fear that i must have been talking darkly like the tragedians
i only mean that some men are changed by persuasion and that others forget argument steals away the hearts of one class and time of the other and this i call theft
now you understand me
yes
those again who are forced are those whom the violence of some pain or grief compels to change their opinion
i understand he said and you are quite right
and you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who change their minds either under the softer influence of pleasure or the sterner influence of fear
yes he said everything that deceives may be said to enchant
therefore as i was just now saying we must enquire who are the best guardians of their own conviction that what they think the interest of the state is to be the rule of their lives
we must watch them from their youth upwards and make them perform actions in which they are most likely to forget or to be deceived and he who remembers and is not deceived is to be selected and he who fails in the trial is to be rejected
that will be the way
yes
and there should also be toils and pains and conflicts prescribed for them in which they will be made to give further proof of the same qualities
very right he replied
and then i said we must try them with enchantments that is the third sort of test and see what will be their behaviour like those who take colts amid noise and tumult to see if they are of a timid nature so must we take our youth amid terrors of some kind and again pass them into pleasures and prove them more thoroughly than gold is proved in the furnace that we may discover whether they are armed against all enchantments and of a noble bearing always good guardians of themselves and of the music which they have learned and retaining under all circumstances a rhythmical and harmonious nature such as will be most serviceable to the individual and to the state
and he who at every age as boy and youth and in mature life has come out of the trial victorious and pure shall be appointed a ruler and guardian of the state he shall be honoured in life and death and shall receive sepulture and other memorials of honour the greatest that we have to give
but him who fails we must reject
i am inclined to think that this is the sort of way in which our rulers and guardians should be chosen and appointed
i speak generally and not with any pretension to exactness
and speaking generally i agree with you he said
and perhaps the word guardian in the fullest sense ought to be applied to this higher class only who preserve us against foreign enemies and maintain peace among our citizens at home that the one may not have the will or the others the power to harm us
the young men whom we before called guardians may be more properly designated auxiliaries and supporters of the principles of the rulers
i agree with you he said
how then may we devise one of those needful falsehoods of which we lately spoke just one royal lie which may deceive the rulers if that be possible and at any rate the rest of the city
what sort of lie
he said
nothing new i replied only an old phoenician tale of what has often occurred before now in other places though not in our time and i do not know whether such an event could ever happen again or could now even be made probable if it did
how your words seem to hesitate on your lips
you will not wonder i replied at my hesitation when you have heard
speak he said and fear not
well then i will speak although i really know not how to look you in the face or in what words to utter the audacious fiction which i propose to communicate gradually first to the rulers then to the soldiers and lastly to the people
they are to be told that their youth was a dream and the education and training which they received from us an appearance only in reality during all that time they were being formed and fed in the womb of the earth where they themselves and their arms and appurtenances were manufactured when they were completed the earth their mother sent them up and so their country being their mother and also their nurse they are bound to advise for her good and to defend her against attacks and her citizens they are to regard as children of the earth and their own brothers
you had good reason he said to be ashamed of the lie which you were going to tell
true i replied but there is more coming i have only told you half
citizens we shall say to them in our tale you are brothers yet god has framed you differently
some of you have the power of command and in the composition of these he has mingled gold wherefore also they have the greatest honour others he has made of silver to be auxiliaries others again who are to be husbandmen and craftsmen he has composed of brass and iron and the species will generally be preserved in the children
but as all are of the same original stock a golden parent will sometimes have a silver son or a silver parent a golden son
and god proclaims as a first principle to the rulers and above all else that there is nothing which they should so anxiously guard or of which they are to be such good guardians as of the purity of the race
they should observe what elements mingle in their offspring for if the son of a golden or silver parent has an admixture of brass and iron then nature orders a transposition of ranks and the eye of the ruler must not be pitiful towards the child because he has to descend in the scale and become a husbandman or artisan just as there may be sons of artisans who having an admixture of gold or silver in them are raised to honour and become guardians or auxiliaries
for an oracle says that when a man of brass or iron guards the state it will be destroyed
such is the tale is there any possibility of making our citizens believe in it
not in the present generation he replied there is no way of accomplishing this but their sons may be made to believe in the tale and their sons sons and posterity after them
i see the difficulty i replied yet the fostering of such a belief will make them care more for the city and for one another
enough however of the fiction which may now fly abroad upon the wings of rumour while we arm our earth born heroes and lead them forth under the command of their rulers
let them look round and select a spot whence they can best suppress insurrection if any prove refractory within and also defend themselves against enemies who like wolves may come down on the fold from without there let them encamp and when they have encamped let them sacrifice to the proper gods and prepare their dwellings
just so he said
and their dwellings must be such as will shield them against the cold of winter and the heat of summer
i suppose that you mean houses he replied
yes i said but they must be the houses of soldiers and not of shop keepers
what is the difference
he said
that i will endeavour to explain i replied
to keep watch dogs who from want of discipline or hunger or some evil habit or other would turn upon the sheep and worry them and behave not like dogs but wolves would be a foul and monstrous thing in a shepherd
truly monstrous he said
and therefore every care must be taken that our auxiliaries being stronger than our citizens may not grow to be too much for them and become savage tyrants instead of friends and allies
yes great care should be taken
and would not a really good education furnish the best safeguard
but they are well educated already he replied
i cannot be so confident my dear glaucon i said i am much more certain that they ought to be and that true education whatever that may be will have the greatest tendency to civilize and humanize them in their relations to one another and to those who are under their protection
very true he replied
and not only their education but their habitations and all that belongs to them should be such as will neither impair their virtue as guardians nor tempt them to prey upon the other citizens
any man of sense must acknowledge that
he must
then now let us consider what will be their way of life if they are to realize our idea of them
in the first place none of them should have any property of his own beyond what is absolutely necessary neither should they have a private house or store closed against any one who has a mind to enter their provisions should be only such as are required by trained warriors who are men of temperance and courage they should agree to receive from the citizens a fixed rate of pay enough to meet the expenses of the year and no more and they will go to mess and live together like soldiers in a camp
gold and silver we will tell them that they have from god the diviner metal is within them and they have therefore no need of the dross which is current among men and ought not to pollute the divine by any such earthly admixture for that commoner metal has been the source of many unholy deeds but their own is undefiled
and they alone of all the citizens may not touch or handle silver or gold or be under the same roof with them or wear them or drink from them
and this will be their salvation and they will be the saviours of the state
but should they ever acquire homes or lands or moneys of their own they will become housekeepers and husbandmen instead of guardians enemies and tyrants instead of allies of the other citizens hating and being hated plotting and being plotted against they will pass their whole life in much greater terror of internal than of external enemies and the hour of ruin both to themselves and to the rest of the state will be at hand
for all which reasons may we not say that thus shall our state be ordered and that these shall be the regulations appointed by us for guardians concerning their houses and all other matters
yes said glaucon
book iv
here adeimantus interposed a question how would you answer socrates said he if a person were to say that you are making these people miserable and that they are the cause of their own unhappiness the city in fact belongs to them but they are none the better for it whereas other men acquire lands and build large and handsome houses and have everything handsome about them offering sacrifices to the gods on their own account and practising hospitality moreover as you were saying just now they have gold and silver and all that is usual among the favourites of fortune but our poor citizens are no better than mercenaries who are quartered in the city and are always mounting guard
yes i said and you may add that they are only fed and not paid in addition to their food like other men and therefore they cannot if they would take a journey of pleasure they have no money to spend on a mistress or any other luxurious fancy which as the world goes is thought to be happiness and many other accusations of the same nature might be added
but said he let us suppose all this to be included in the charge
you mean to ask i said what will be our answer
yes
if we proceed along the old path my belief i said is that we shall find the answer
and our answer will be that even as they are our guardians may very likely be the happiest of men but that our aim in founding the state was not the disproportionate happiness of any one class but the greatest happiness of the whole we thought that in a state which is ordered with a view to the good of the whole we should be most likely to find justice and in the ill ordered state injustice and having found them we might then decide which of the two is the happier
at present i take it we are fashioning the happy state not piecemeal or with a view of making a few happy citizens but as a whole and by and by we will proceed to view the opposite kind of state
suppose that we were painting a statue and some one came up to us and said why do you not put the most beautiful colours on the most beautiful parts of the body the eyes ought to be purple but you have made them black to him we might fairly answer sir you would not surely have us beautify the eyes to such a degree that they are no longer eyes consider rather whether by giving this and the other features their due proportion we make the whole beautiful
and so i say to you do not compel us to assign to the guardians a sort of happiness which will make them anything but guardians for we too can clothe our husbandmen in royal apparel and set crowns of gold on their heads and bid them till the ground as much as they like and no more
our potters also might be allowed to repose on couches and feast by the fireside passing round the winecup while their wheel is conveniently at hand and working at pottery only as much as they like in this way we might make every class happy and then as you imagine the whole state would be happy
but do not put this idea into our heads for if we listen to you the husbandman will be no longer a husbandman the potter will cease to be a potter and no one will have the character of any distinct class in the state
now this is not of much consequence where the corruption of society and pretension to be what you are not is confined to cobblers but when the guardians of the laws and of the government are only seeming and not real guardians then see how they turn the state upside down and on the other hand they alone have the power of giving order and happiness to the state
we mean our guardians to be true saviours and not the destroyers of the state whereas our opponent is thinking of peasants at a festival who are enjoying a life of revelry not of citizens who are doing their duty to the state
but if so we mean different things and he is speaking of something which is not a state
and therefore we must consider whether in appointing our guardians we would look to their greatest happiness individually or whether this principle of happiness does not rather reside in the state as a whole
but if the latter be the truth then the guardians and auxiliaries and all others equally with them must be compelled or induced to do their own work in the best way
and thus the whole state will grow up in a noble order and the several classes will receive the proportion of happiness which nature assigns to them
i think that you are quite right
i wonder whether you will agree with another remark which occurs to me
what may that be
there seem to be two causes of the deterioration of the arts
what are they
wealth i said and poverty
how do they act
the process is as follows when a potter becomes rich will he think you any longer take the same pains with his art
certainly not
he will grow more and more indolent and careless
very true
and the result will be that he becomes a worse potter
yes he greatly deteriorates
but on the other hand if he has no money and cannot provide himself with tools or instruments he will not work equally well himself nor will he teach his sons or apprentices to work equally well
certainly not
then under the influence either of poverty or of wealth workmen and their work are equally liable to degenerate
that is evident
here then is a discovery of new evils i said against which the guardians will have to watch or they will creep into the city unobserved
what evils
wealth i said and poverty the one is the parent of luxury and indolence and the other of meanness and viciousness and both of discontent
that is very true he replied but still i should like to know socrates how our city will be able to go to war especially against an enemy who is rich and powerful if deprived of the sinews of war
there would certainly be a difficulty i replied in going to war with one such enemy but there is no difficulty where there are two of them
how so
he asked
in the first place i said if we have to fight our side will be trained warriors fighting against an army of rich men
that is true he said
and do you not suppose adeimantus that a single boxer who was perfect in his art would easily be a match for two stout and well to do gentlemen who were not boxers
hardly if they came upon him at once
what now i said if he were able to run away and then turn and strike at the one who first came up
and supposing he were to do this several times under the heat of a scorching sun might he not being an expert overturn more than one stout personage
certainly he said there would be nothing wonderful in that
and yet rich men probably have a greater superiority in the science and practise of boxing than they have in military qualities
likely enough
then we may assume that our athletes will be able to fight with two or three times their own number
i agree with you for i think you right
and suppose that before engaging our citizens send an embassy to one of the two cities telling them what is the truth silver and gold we neither have nor are permitted to have but you may do you therefore come and help us in war and take the spoils of the other city who on hearing these words would choose to fight against lean wiry dogs rather than with the dogs on their side against fat and tender sheep
that is not likely and yet there might be a danger to the poor state if the wealth of many states were to be gathered into one
but how simple of you to use the term state at all of any but our own
why so
you ought to speak of other states in the plural number not one of them is a city but many cities as they say in the game
for indeed any city however small is in fact divided into two one the city of the poor the other of the rich these are at war with one another and in either there are many smaller divisions and you would be altogether beside the mark if you treated them all as a single state
but if you deal with them as many and give the wealth or power or persons of the one to the others you will always have a great many friends and not many enemies
and your state while the wise order which has now been prescribed continues to prevail in her will be the greatest of states i do not mean to say in reputation or appearance but in deed and truth though she number not more than a thousand defenders
a single state which is her equal you will hardly find either among hellenes or barbarians though many that appear to be as great and many times greater
that is most true he said
and what i said will be the best limit for our rulers to fix when they are considering the size of the state and the amount of territory which they are to include and beyond which they will not go
what limit would you propose
i would allow the state to increase so far as is consistent with unity that i think is the proper limit
very good he said
here then i said is another order which will have to be conveyed to our guardians let our city be accounted neither large nor small but one and self sufficing
and surely said he this is not a very severe order which we impose upon them
and the other said i of which we were speaking before is lighter still i mean the duty of degrading the offspring of the guardians when inferior and of elevating into the rank of guardians the offspring of the lower classes when naturally superior
the intention was that in the case of the citizens generally each individual should be put to the use for which nature intended him one to one work and then every man would do his own business and be one and not many and so the whole city would be one and not many
yes he said that is not so difficult
the regulations which we are prescribing my good adeimantus are not as might be supposed a number of great principles but trifles all if care be taken as the saying is of the one great thing a thing however which i would rather call not great but sufficient for our purpose
what may that be
he asked
education i said and nurture if our citizens are well educated and grow into sensible men they will easily see their way through all these as well as other matters which i omit such for example as marriage the possession of women and the procreation of children which will all follow the general principle that friends have all things in common as the proverb says
that will be the best way of settling them
also i said the state if once started well moves with accumulating force like a wheel
for good nurture and education implant good constitutions and these good constitutions taking root in a good education improve more and more and this improvement affects the breed in man as in other animals
very possibly he said
then to sum up this is the point to which above all the attention of our rulers should be directed that music and gymnastic be preserved in their original form and no innovation made
they must do their utmost to maintain them intact
and when any one says that mankind most regard the newest song which the singers have they will be afraid that he may be praising not new songs but a new kind of song and this ought not to be praised or conceived to be the meaning of the poet for any musical innovation is full of danger to the whole state and ought to be prohibited
so damon tells me and i can quite believe him he says that when modes of music change the fundamental laws of the state always change with them
yes said adeimantus and you may add my suffrage to damon s and your own
then i said our guardians must lay the foundations of their fortress in music
yes he said the lawlessness of which you speak too easily steals in
yes i replied in the form of amusement and at first sight it appears harmless
why yes he said and there is no harm were it not that little by little this spirit of licence finding a home imperceptibly penetrates into manners and customs whence issuing with greater force it invades contracts between man and man and from contracts goes on to laws and constitutions in utter recklessness ending at last socrates by an overthrow of all rights private as well as public
is that true
i said
that is my belief he replied
then as i was saying our youth should be trained from the first in a stricter system for if amusements become lawless and the youths themselves become lawless they can never grow up into well conducted and virtuous citizens
very true he said
and when they have made a good beginning in play and by the help of music have gained the habit of good order then this habit of order in a manner how unlike the lawless play of the others
will accompany them in all their actions and be a principle of growth to them and if there be any fallen places in the state will raise them up again
very true he said
thus educated they will invent for themselves any lesser rules which their predecessors have altogether neglected
what do you mean
i mean such things as these when the young are to be silent before their elders how they are to show respect to them by standing and making them sit what honour is due to parents what garments or shoes are to be worn the mode of dressing the hair deportment and manners in general
you would agree with me
yes
but there is i think small wisdom in legislating about such matters i doubt if it is ever done nor are any precise written enactments about them likely to be lasting
impossible
it would seem adeimantus that the direction in which education starts a man will determine his future life
does not like always attract like
to be sure
until some one rare and grand result is reached which may be good and may be the reverse of good
that is not to be denied
and for this reason i said i shall not attempt to legislate further about them
naturally enough he replied
well and about the business of the agora and the ordinary dealings between man and man or again about agreements with artisans about insult and injury or the commencement of actions and the appointment of juries what would you say
there may also arise questions about any impositions and exactions of market and harbour dues which may be required and in general about the regulations of markets police harbours and the like
but oh heavens
shall we condescend to legislate on any of these particulars
i think he said that there is no need to impose laws about them on good men what regulations are necessary they will find out soon enough for themselves
yes i said my friend if god will only preserve to them the laws which we have given them
and without divine help said adeimantus they will go on for ever making and mending their laws and their lives in the hope of attaining perfection
you would compare them i said to those invalids who having no self restraint will not leave off their habits of intemperance
exactly
yes i said and what a delightful life they lead
they are always doctoring and increasing and complicating their disorders and always fancying that they will be cured by any nostrum which anybody advises them to try
such cases are very common he said with invalids of this sort
yes i replied and the charming thing is that they deem him their worst enemy who tells them the truth which is simply that unless they give up eating and drinking and wenching and idling neither drug nor cautery nor spell nor amulet nor any other remedy will avail
charming
he replied
i see nothing charming in going into a passion with a man who tells you what is right
these gentlemen i said do not seem to be in your good graces
assuredly not
nor would you praise the behaviour of states which act like the men whom i was just now describing
for are there not ill ordered states in which the citizens are forbidden under pain of death to alter the constitution and yet he who most sweetly courts those who live under this regime and indulges them and fawns upon them and is skilful in anticipating and gratifying their humours is held to be a great and good statesman do not these states resemble the persons whom i was describing
yes he said the states are as bad as the men and i am very far from praising them
but do you not admire i said the coolness and dexterity of these ready ministers of political corruption
yes he said i do but not of all of them for there are some whom the applause of the multitude has deluded into the belief that they are really statesmen and these are not much to be admired
what do you mean
i said you should have more feeling for them
when a man cannot measure and a great many others who cannot measure declare that he is four cubits high can he help believing what they say
nay he said certainly not in that case
well then do not be angry with them for are they not as good as a play trying their hand at paltry reforms such as i was describing they are always fancying that by legislation they will make an end of frauds in contracts and the other rascalities which i was mentioning not knowing that they are in reality cutting off the heads of a hydra
yes he said that is just what they are doing
i conceive i said that the true legislator will not trouble himself with this class of enactments whether concerning laws or the constitution either in an ill ordered or in a well ordered state for in the former they are quite useless and in the latter there will be no difficulty in devising them and many of them will naturally flow out of our previous regulations
what then he said is still remaining to us of the work of legislation
nothing to us i replied but to apollo the god of delphi there remains the ordering of the greatest and noblest and chiefest things of all
which are they
he said
the institution of temples and sacrifices and the entire service of gods demigods and heroes also the ordering of the repositories of the dead and the rites which have to be observed by him who would propitiate the inhabitants of the world below
these are matters of which we are ignorant ourselves and as founders of a city we should be unwise in trusting them to any interpreter but our ancestral deity
he is the god who sits in the centre on the navel of the earth and he is the interpreter of religion to all mankind
you are right and we will do as you propose
but where amid all this is justice
son of ariston tell me where
now that our city has been made habitable light a candle and search and get your brother and polemarchus and the rest of our friends to help and let us see where in it we can discover justice and where injustice and in what they differ from one another and which of them the man who would be happy should have for his portion whether seen or unseen by gods and men
nonsense said glaucon did you not promise to search yourself saying that for you not to help justice in her need would be an impiety
i do not deny that i said so and as you remind me i will be as good as my word but you must join
we will he replied
well then i hope to make the discovery in this way i mean to begin with the assumption that our state if rightly ordered is perfect
that is most certain
and being perfect is therefore wise and valiant and temperate and just
that is likewise clear
and whichever of these qualities we find in the state the one which is not found will be the residue
very good
if there were four things and we were searching for one of them wherever it might be the one sought for might be known to us from the first and there would be no further trouble or we might know the other three first and then the fourth would clearly be the one left
very true he said
and is not a similar method to be pursued about the virtues which are also four in number
clearly
first among the virtues found in the state wisdom comes into view and in this i detect a certain peculiarity
what is that
the state which we have been describing is said to be wise as being good in counsel
very true
and good counsel is clearly a kind of knowledge for not by ignorance but by knowledge do men counsel well
clearly
and the kinds of knowledge in a state are many and diverse
of course
there is the knowledge of the carpenter but is that the sort of knowledge which gives a city the title of wise and good in counsel
certainly not that would only give a city the reputation of skill in carpentering
then a city is not to be called wise because possessing a knowledge which counsels for the best about wooden implements
certainly not
nor by reason of a knowledge which advises about brazen pots i said nor as possessing any other similar knowledge
not by reason of any of them he said
nor yet by reason of a knowledge which cultivates the earth that would give the city the name of agricultural
yes
well i said and is there any knowledge in our recently founded state among any of the citizens which advises not about any particular thing in the state but about the whole and considers how a state can best deal with itself and with other states
there certainly is
and what is this knowledge and among whom is it found
i asked
it is the knowledge of the guardians he replied and is found among those whom we were just now describing as perfect guardians
and what is the name which the city derives from the possession of this sort of knowledge
the name of good in counsel and truly wise
and will there be in our city more of these true guardians or more smiths
the smiths he replied will be far more numerous
will not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive a name from the profession of some kind of knowledge
much the smallest
and so by reason of the smallest part or class and of the knowledge which resides in this presiding and ruling part of itself the whole state being thus constituted according to nature will be wise and this which has the only knowledge worthy to be called wisdom has been ordained by nature to be of all classes the least
most true
thus then i said the nature and place in the state of one of the four virtues has somehow or other been discovered
and in my humble opinion very satisfactorily discovered he replied
again i said there is no difficulty in seeing the nature of courage and in what part that quality resides which gives the name of courageous to the state
how do you mean
why i said every one who calls any state courageous or cowardly will be thinking of the part which fights and goes out to war on the state s behalf
no one he replied would ever think of any other
the rest of the citizens may be courageous or may be cowardly but their courage or cowardice will not as i conceive have the effect of making the city either the one or the other
certainly not
the city will be courageous in virtue of a portion of herself which preserves under all circumstances that opinion about the nature of things to be feared and not to be feared in which our legislator educated them and this is what you term courage
i should like to hear what you are saying once more for i do not think that i perfectly understand you
i mean that courage is a kind of salvation
salvation of what
of the opinion respecting things to be feared what they are and of what nature which the law implants through education and i mean by the words under all circumstances to intimate that in pleasure or in pain or under the influence of desire or fear a man preserves and does not lose this opinion
shall i give you an illustration
if you please
you know i said that dyers when they want to dye wool for making the true sea purple begin by selecting their white colour first this they prepare and dress with much care and pains in order that the white ground may take the purple hue in full perfection
the dyeing then proceeds and whatever is dyed in this manner becomes a fast colour and no washing either with lyes or without them can take away the bloom
but when the ground has not been duly prepared you will have noticed how poor is the look either of purple or of any other colour
yes he said i know that they have a washed out and ridiculous appearance
then now i said you will understand what our object was in selecting our soldiers and educating them in music and gymnastic we were contriving influences which would prepare them to take the dye of the laws in perfection and the colour of their opinion about dangers and of every other opinion was to be indelibly fixed by their nurture and training not to be washed away by such potent lyes as pleasure mightier agent far in washing the soul than any soda or lye or by sorrow fear and desire the mightiest of all other solvents
and this sort of universal saving power of true opinion in conformity with law about real and false dangers i call and maintain to be courage unless you disagree
but i agree he replied for i suppose that you mean to exclude mere uninstructed courage such as that of a wild beast or of a slave this in your opinion is not the courage which the law ordains and ought to have another name
most certainly
then i may infer courage to be such as you describe
why yes said i you may and if you add the words of a citizen you will not be far wrong hereafter if you like we will carry the examination further but at present we are seeking not for courage but justice and for the purpose of our enquiry we have said enough
you are right he replied
two virtues remain to be discovered in the state first temperance and then justice which is the end of our search
very true
now can we find justice without troubling ourselves about temperance
i do not know how that can be accomplished he said nor do i desire that justice should be brought to light and temperance lost sight of and therefore i wish that you would do me the favour of considering temperance first
certainly i replied i should not be justified in refusing your request
then consider he said
yes i replied i will and as far as i can at present see the virtue of temperance has more of the nature of harmony and symphony than the preceding
how so
he asked
temperance i replied is the ordering or controlling of certain pleasures and desires this is curiously enough implied in the saying of a man being his own master and other traces of the same notion may be found in language
no doubt he said
there is something ridiculous in the expression master of himself for the master is also the servant and the servant the master and in all these modes of speaking the same person is denoted
certainly
the meaning is i believe that in the human soul there is a better and also a worse principle and when the better has the worse under control then a man is said to be master of himself and this is a term of praise but when owing to evil education or association the better principle which is also the smaller is overwhelmed by the greater mass of the worse in this case he is blamed and is called the slave of self and unprincipled
yes there is reason in that
and now i said look at our newly created state and there you will find one of these two conditions realized for the state as you will acknowledge may be justly called master of itself if the words temperance and self mastery truly express the rule of the better part over the worse
yes he said i see that what you say is true
let me further note that the manifold and complex pleasures and desires and pains are generally found in children and women and servants and in the freemen so called who are of the lowest and more numerous class
certainly he said
whereas the simple and moderate desires which follow reason and are under the guidance of mind and true opinion are to be found only in a few and those the best born and best educated
very true
these two as you may perceive have a place in our state and the meaner desires of the many are held down by the virtuous desires and wisdom of the few
that i perceive he said
then if there be any city which may be described as master of its own pleasures and desires and master of itself ours may claim such a designation
certainly he replied
it may also be called temperate and for the same reasons
yes
and if there be any state in which rulers and subjects will be agreed as to the question who are to rule that again will be our state
undoubtedly
and the citizens being thus agreed among themselves in which class will temperance be found in the rulers or in the subjects
in both as i should imagine he replied
do you observe that we were not far wrong in our guess that temperance was a sort of harmony
why so
why because temperance is unlike courage and wisdom each of which resides in a part only the one making the state wise and the other valiant not so temperance which extends to the whole and runs through all the notes of the scale and produces a harmony of the weaker and the stronger and the middle class whether you suppose them to be stronger or weaker in wisdom or power or numbers or wealth or anything else
most truly then may we deem temperance to be the agreement of the naturally superior and inferior as to the right to rule of either both in states and individuals
i entirely agree with you
and so i said we may consider three out of the four virtues to have been discovered in our state
the last of those qualities which make a state virtuous must be justice if we only knew what that was
the inference is obvious
the time then has arrived glaucon when like huntsmen we should surround the cover and look sharp that justice does not steal away and pass out of sight and escape us for beyond a doubt she is somewhere in this country watch therefore and strive to catch a sight of her and if you see her first let me know
would that i could
but you should regard me rather as a follower who has just eyes enough to see what you show him that is about as much as i am good for
offer up a prayer with me and follow
i will but you must show me the way
here is no path i said and the wood is dark and perplexing still we must push on
let us push on
here i saw something halloo
i said i begin to perceive a track and i believe that the quarry will not escape
good news he said
truly i said we are stupid fellows
why so
why my good sir at the beginning of our enquiry ages ago there was justice tumbling out at our feet and we never saw her nothing could be more ridiculous
like people who go about looking for what they have in their hands that was the way with us we looked not at what we were seeking but at what was far off in the distance and therefore i suppose we missed her
what do you mean
i mean to say that in reality for a long time past we have been talking of justice and have failed to recognise her
i grow impatient at the length of your exordium
well then tell me i said whether i am right or not you remember the original principle which we were always laying down at the foundation of the state that one man should practise one thing only the thing to which his nature was best adapted now justice is this principle or a part of it
yes we often said that one man should do one thing only
further we affirmed that justice was doing one s own business and not being a busybody we said so again and again and many others have said the same to us
yes we said so
then to do one s own business in a certain way may be assumed to be justice
can you tell me whence i derive this inference
i cannot but i should like to be told
because i think that this is the only virtue which remains in the state when the other virtues of temperance and courage and wisdom are abstracted and that this is the ultimate cause and condition of the existence of all of them and while remaining in them is also their preservative and we were saying that if the three were discovered by us justice would be the fourth or remaining one
that follows of necessity
if we are asked to determine which of these four qualities by its presence contributes most to the excellence of the state whether the agreement of rulers and subjects or the preservation in the soldiers of the opinion which the law ordains about the true nature of dangers or wisdom and watchfulness in the rulers or whether this other which i am mentioning and which is found in children and women slave and freeman artisan ruler subject the quality i mean of every one doing his own work and not being a busybody would claim the palm the question is not so easily answered
certainly he replied there would be a difficulty in saying which
then the power of each individual in the state to do his own work appears to compete with the other political virtues wisdom temperance courage
yes he said
and the virtue which enters into this competition is justice
exactly
let us look at the question from another point of view are not the rulers in a state those to whom you would entrust the office of determining suits at law
certainly
and are suits decided on any other ground but that a man may neither take what is another s nor be deprived of what is his own
yes that is their principle
which is a just principle
yes
then on this view also justice will be admitted to be the having and doing what is a man s own and belongs to him
very true
think now and say whether you agree with me or not
suppose a carpenter to be doing the business of a cobbler or a cobbler of a carpenter and suppose them to exchange their implements or their duties or the same person to be doing the work of both or whatever be the change do you think that any great harm would result to the state
not much
but when the cobbler or any other man whom nature designed to be a trader having his heart lifted up by wealth or strength or the number of his followers or any like advantage attempts to force his way into the class of warriors or a warrior into that of legislators and guardians for which he is unfitted and either to take the implements or the duties of the other or when one man is trader legislator and warrior all in one then i think you will agree with me in saying that this interchange and this meddling of one with another is the ruin of the state
most true
seeing then i said that there are three distinct classes any meddling of one with another or the change of one into another is the greatest harm to the state and may be most justly termed evil doing
precisely
and the greatest degree of evil doing to one s own city would be termed by you injustice
certainly
this then is injustice and on the other hand when the trader the auxiliary and the guardian each do their own business that is justice and will make the city just
i agree with you
we will not i said be over positive as yet but if on trial this conception of justice be verified in the individual as well as in the state there will be no longer any room for doubt if it be not verified we must have a fresh enquiry
first let us complete the old investigation which we began as you remember under the impression that if we could previously examine justice on the larger scale there would be less difficulty in discerning her in the individual
that larger example appeared to be the state and accordingly we constructed as good a one as we could knowing well that in the good state justice would be found
let the discovery which we made be now applied to the individual if they agree we shall be satisfied or if there be a difference in the individual we will come back to the state and have another trial of the theory
the friction of the two when rubbed together may possibly strike a light in which justice will shine forth and the vision which is then revealed we will fix in our souls
that will be in regular course let us do as you say
i proceeded to ask when two things a greater and less are called by the same name are they like or unlike in so far as they are called the same
like he replied
the just man then if we regard the idea of justice only will be like the just state
he will
and a state was thought by us to be just when the three classes in the state severally did their own business and also thought to be temperate and valiant and wise by reason of certain other affections and qualities of these same classes
true he said
and so of the individual we may assume that he has the same three principles in his own soul which are found in the state and he may be rightly described in the same terms because he is affected in the same manner
certainly he said
once more then o my friend we have alighted upon an easy question whether the soul has these three principles or not
an easy question
nay rather socrates the proverb holds that hard is the good
very true i said and i do not think that the method which we are employing is at all adequate to the accurate solution of this question the true method is another and a longer one
still we may arrive at a solution not below the level of the previous enquiry
may we not be satisfied with that
he said under the circumstances i am quite content
i too i replied shall be extremely well satisfied
then faint not in pursuing the speculation he said
must we not acknowledge i said that in each of us there are the same principles and habits which there are in the state and that from the individual they pass into the state
how else can they come there
take the quality of passion or spirit it would be ridiculous to imagine that this quality when found in states is not derived from the individuals who are supposed to possess it e.g
the thracians scythians and in general the northern nations and the same may be said of the love of knowledge which is the special characteristic of our part of the world or of the love of money which may with equal truth be attributed to the phoenicians and egyptians
exactly so he said
there is no difficulty in understanding this
none whatever
but the question is not quite so easy when we proceed to ask whether these principles are three or one whether that is to say we learn with one part of our nature are angry with another and with a third part desire the satisfaction of our natural appetites or whether the whole soul comes into play in each sort of action to determine that is the difficulty
yes he said there lies the difficulty
then let us now try and determine whether they are the same or different
how can we
he asked
i replied as follows the same thing clearly cannot act or be acted upon in the same part or in relation to the same thing at the same time in contrary ways and therefore whenever this contradiction occurs in things apparently the same we know that they are really not the same but different
good
for example i said can the same thing be at rest and in motion at the same time in the same part
impossible
still i said let us have a more precise statement of terms lest we should hereafter fall out by the way
imagine the case of a man who is standing and also moving his hands and his head and suppose a person to say that one and the same person is in motion and at rest at the same moment to such a mode of speech we should object and should rather say that one part of him is in motion while another is at rest
very true
and suppose the objector to refine still further and to draw the nice distinction that not only parts of tops but whole tops when they spin round with their pegs fixed on the spot are at rest and in motion at the same time his objection would not be admitted by us because in such cases things are not at rest and in motion in the same parts of themselves we should rather say that they have both an axis and a circumference and that the axis stands still for there is no deviation from the perpendicular and that the circumference goes round
but if while revolving the axis inclines either to the right or left forwards or backwards then in no point of view can they be at rest
that is the correct mode of describing them he replied
then none of these objections will confuse us or incline us to believe that the same thing at the same time in the same part or in relation to the same thing can act or be acted upon in contrary ways
certainly not according to my way of thinking
yet i said that we may not be compelled to examine all such objections and prove at length that they are untrue let us assume their absurdity and go forward on the understanding that hereafter if this assumption turn out to be untrue all the consequences which follow shall be withdrawn
yes he said that will be the best way
well i said would you not allow that assent and dissent desire and aversion attraction and repulsion are all of them opposites whether they are regarded as active or passive 
yes he said they are opposites
well i said and hunger and thirst and the desires in general and again willing and wishing all these you would refer to the classes already mentioned
you would say would you not
that the soul of him who desires is seeking after the object of his desire or that he is drawing to himself the thing which he wishes to possess or again when a person wants anything to be given him his mind longing for the realization of his desire intimates his wish to have it by a nod of assent as if he had been asked a question
very true
and what would you say of unwillingness and dislike and the absence of desire should not these be referred to the opposite class of repulsion and rejection
certainly
admitting this to be true of desire generally let us suppose a particular class of desires and out of these we will select hunger and thirst as they are termed which are the most obvious of them
let us take that class he said
the object of one is food and of the other drink
yes
and here comes the point is not thirst the desire which the soul has of drink and of drink only not of drink qualified by anything else for example warm or cold or much or little or in a word drink of any particular sort but if the thirst be accompanied by heat then the desire is of cold drink or if accompanied by cold then of warm drink or if the thirst be excessive then the drink which is desired will be excessive or if not great the quantity of drink will also be small but thirst pure and simple will desire drink pure and simple which is the natural satisfaction of thirst as food is of hunger
yes he said the simple desire is as you say in every case of the simple object and the qualified desire of the qualified object
but here a confusion may arise and i should wish to guard against an opponent starting up and saying that no man desires drink only but good drink or food only but good food for good is the universal object of desire and thirst being a desire will necessarily be thirst after good drink and the same is true of every other desire
yes he replied the opponent might have something to say
nevertheless i should still maintain that of relatives some have a quality attached to either term of the relation others are simple and have their correlatives simple
i do not know what you mean
well you know of course that the greater is relative to the less
certainly
and the much greater to the much less
yes
and the sometime greater to the sometime less and the greater that is to be to the less that is to be
certainly he said
and so of more and less and of other correlative terms such as the double and the half or again the heavier and the lighter the swifter and the slower and of hot and cold and of any other relatives is not this true of all of them
yes
and does not the same principle hold in the sciences
the object of science is knowledge but the object of a particular science is a particular kind of knowledge i mean for example that the science of house building is a kind of knowledge which is defined and distinguished from other kinds and is therefore termed architecture
certainly
because it has a particular quality which no other has
yes
and it has this particular quality because it has an object of a particular kind and this is true of the other arts and sciences
yes
now then if i have made myself clear you will understand my original meaning in what i said about relatives
my meaning was that if one term of a relation is taken alone the other is taken alone if one term is qualified the other is also qualified
i do not mean to say that relatives may not be disparate or that the science of health is healthy or of disease necessarily diseased or that the sciences of good and evil are therefore good and evil but only that when the term science is no longer used absolutely but has a qualified object which in this case is the nature of health and disease it becomes defined and is hence called not merely science but the science of medicine
i quite understand and i think as you do
would you not say that thirst is one of these essentially relative terms having clearly a relation yes thirst is relative to drink
and a certain kind of thirst is relative to a certain kind of drink but thirst taken alone is neither of much nor little nor of good nor bad nor of any particular kind of drink but of drink only
certainly
then the soul of the thirsty one in so far as he is thirsty desires only drink for this he yearns and tries to obtain it
that is plain
and if you suppose something which pulls a thirsty soul away from drink that must be different from the thirsty principle which draws him like a beast to drink for as we were saying the same thing cannot at the same time with the same part of itself act in contrary ways about the same
impossible
no more than you can say that the hands of the archer push and pull the bow at the same time but what you say is that one hand pushes and the other pulls
exactly so he replied
and might a man be thirsty and yet unwilling to drink
yes he said it constantly happens
and in such a case what is one to say
would you not say that there was something in the soul bidding a man to drink and something else forbidding him which is other and stronger than the principle which bids him
i should say so
and the forbidding principle is derived from reason and that which bids and attracts proceeds from passion and disease
clearly
then we may fairly assume that they are two and that they differ from one another the one with which a man reasons we may call the rational principle of the soul the other with which he loves and hungers and thirsts and feels the flutterings of any other desire may be termed the irrational or appetitive the ally of sundry pleasures and satisfactions
yes he said we may fairly assume them to be different
then let us finally determine that there are two principles existing in the soul
and what of passion or spirit
is it a third or akin to one of the preceding
i should be inclined to say akin to desire
well i said there is a story which i remember to have heard and in which i put faith
the story is that leontius the son of aglaion coming up one day from the piraeus under the north wall on the outside observed some dead bodies lying on the ground at the place of execution
he felt a desire to see them and also a dread and abhorrence of them for a time he struggled and covered his eyes but at length the desire got the better of him and forcing them open he ran up to the dead bodies saying look ye wretches take your fill of the fair sight
i have heard the story myself he said
the moral of the tale is that anger at times goes to war with desire as though they were two distinct things
yes that is the meaning he said
and are there not many other cases in which we observe that when a man s desires violently prevail over his reason he reviles himself and is angry at the violence within him and that in this struggle which is like the struggle of factions in a state his spirit is on the side of his reason but for the passionate or spirited element to take part with the desires when reason decides that she should not be opposed is a sort of thing which i believe that you never observed occurring in yourself nor as i should imagine in any one else
certainly not
suppose that a man thinks he has done a wrong to another the nobler he is the less able is he to feel indignant at any suffering such as hunger or cold or any other pain which the injured person may inflict upon him these he deems to be just and as i say his anger refuses to be excited by them
true he said
but when he thinks that he is the sufferer of the wrong then he boils and chafes and is on the side of what he believes to be justice and because he suffers hunger or cold or other pain he is only the more determined to persevere and conquer
his noble spirit will not be quelled until he either slays or is slain or until he hears the voice of the shepherd that is reason bidding his dog bark no more
the illustration is perfect he replied and in our state as we were saying the auxiliaries were to be dogs and to hear the voice of the rulers who are their shepherds
i perceive i said that you quite understand me there is however a further point which i wish you to consider
what point
you remember that passion or spirit appeared at first sight to be a kind of desire but now we should say quite the contrary for in the conflict of the soul spirit is arrayed on the side of the rational principle
most assuredly
but a further question arises is passion different from reason also or only a kind of reason in which latter case instead of three principles in the soul there will only be two the rational and the concupiscent or rather as the state was composed of three classes traders auxiliaries counsellors so may there not be in the individual soul a third element which is passion or spirit and when not corrupted by bad education is the natural auxiliary of reason
yes he said there must be a third
yes i replied if passion which has already been shown to be different from desire turn out also to be different from reason
but that is easily proved we may observe even in young children that they are full of spirit almost as soon as they are born whereas some of them never seem to attain to the use of reason and most of them late enough
excellent i said and you may see passion equally in brute animals which is a further proof of the truth of what you are saying
and we may once more appeal to the words of homer which have been already quoted by us he smote his breast and thus rebuked his soul for in this verse homer has clearly supposed the power which reasons about the better and worse to be different from the unreasoning anger which is rebuked by it
very true he said
and so after much tossing we have reached land and are fairly agreed that the same principles which exist in the state exist also in the individual and that they are three in number
exactly
must we not then infer that the individual is wise in the same way and in virtue of the same quality which makes the state wise
certainly
also that the same quality which constitutes courage in the state constitutes courage in the individual and that both the state and the individual bear the same relation to all the other virtues
assuredly
and the individual will be acknowledged by us to be just in the same way in which the state is just
that follows of course
we cannot but remember that the justice of the state consisted in each of the three classes doing the work of its own class
we are not very likely to have forgotten he said
we must recollect that the individual in whom the several qualities of his nature do their own work will be just and will do his own work
yes he said we must remember that too
and ought not the rational principle which is wise and has the care of the whole soul to rule and the passionate or spirited principle to be the subject and ally
certainly
and as we were saying the united influence of music and gymnastic will bring them into accord nerving and sustaining the reason with noble words and lessons and moderating and soothing and civilizing the wildness of passion by harmony and rhythm
quite true he said
and these two thus nurtured and educated and having learned truly to know their own functions will rule over the concupiscent which in each of us is the largest part of the soul and by nature most insatiable of gain over this they will keep guard lest waxing great and strong with the fulness of bodily pleasures as they are termed the concupiscent soul no longer confined to her own sphere should attempt to enslave and rule those who are not her natural born subjects and overturn the whole life of man
very true he said
both together will they not be the best defenders of the whole soul and the whole body against attacks from without the one counselling and the other fighting under his leader and courageously executing his commands and counsels
true
and he is to be deemed courageous whose spirit retains in pleasure and in pain the commands of reason about what he ought or ought not to fear
right he replied
and him we call wise who has in him that little part which rules and which proclaims these commands that part too being supposed to have a knowledge of what is for the interest of each of the three parts and of the whole
assuredly
and would you not say that he is temperate who has these same elements in friendly harmony in whom the one ruling principle of reason and the two subject ones of spirit and desire are equally agreed that reason ought to rule and do not rebel
certainly he said that is the true account of temperance whether in the state or individual
and surely i said we have explained again and again how and by virtue of what quality a man will be just
that is very certain
and is justice dimmer in the individual and is her form different or is she the same which we found her to be in the state
there is no difference in my opinion he said
because if any doubt is still lingering in our minds a few commonplace instances will satisfy us of the truth of what i am saying
what sort of instances do you mean
if the case is put to us must we not admit that the just state or the man who is trained in the principles of such a state will be less likely than the unjust to make away with a deposit of gold or silver
would any one deny this
no one he replied
will the just man or citizen ever be guilty of sacrilege or theft or treachery either to his friends or to his country
never
neither will he ever break faith where there have been oaths or agreements
impossible
no one will be less likely to commit adultery or to dishonour his father and mother or to fail in his religious duties
no one
and the reason is that each part of him is doing its own business whether in ruling or being ruled
exactly so
are you satisfied then that the quality which makes such men and such states is justice or do you hope to discover some other
not i indeed
then our dream has been realized and the suspicion which we entertained at the beginning of our work of construction that some divine power must have conducted us to a primary form of justice has now been verified
yes certainly
and the division of labour which required the carpenter and the shoemaker and the rest of the citizens to be doing each his own business and not another s was a shadow of justice and for that reason it was of use
clearly
but in reality justice was such as we were describing being concerned however not with the outward man but with the inward which is the true self and concernment of man for the just man does not permit the several elements within him to interfere with one another or any of them to do the work of others he sets in order his own inner life and is his own master and his own law and at peace with himself and when he has bound together the three principles within him which may be compared to the higher lower and middle notes of the scale and the intermediate intervals when he has bound all these together and is no longer many but has become one entirely temperate and perfectly adjusted nature then he proceeds to act if he has to act whether in a matter of property or in the treatment of the body or in some affair of politics or private business always thinking and calling that which preserves and co operates with this harmonious condition just and good action and the knowledge which presides over it wisdom and that which at any time impairs this condition he will call unjust action and the opinion which presides over it ignorance
you have said the exact truth socrates
very good and if we were to affirm that we had discovered the just man and the just state and the nature of justice in each of them we should not be telling a falsehood
most certainly not
may we say so then
let us say so
and now i said injustice has to be considered
clearly
must not injustice be a strife which arises among the three principles a meddlesomeness and interference and rising up of a part of the soul against the whole an assertion of unlawful authority which is made by a rebellious subject against a true prince of whom he is the natural vassal what is all this confusion and delusion but injustice and intemperance and cowardice and ignorance and every form of vice
exactly so
and if the nature of justice and injustice be known then the meaning of acting unjustly and being unjust or again of acting justly will also be perfectly clear
what do you mean
he said
why i said they are like disease and health being in the soul just what disease and health are in the body
how so
he said
why i said that which is healthy causes health and that which is unhealthy causes disease
yes
and just actions cause justice and unjust actions cause injustice
that is certain
and the creation of health is the institution of a natural order and government of one by another in the parts of the body and the creation of disease is the production of a state of things at variance with this natural order
true
and is not the creation of justice the institution of a natural order and government of one by another in the parts of the soul and the creation of injustice the production of a state of things at variance with the natural order
exactly so he said
then virtue is the health and beauty and well being of the soul and vice the disease and weakness and deformity of the same
true
and do not good practices lead to virtue and evil practices to vice
assuredly
still our old question of the comparative advantage of justice and injustice has not been answered which is the more profitable to be just and act justly and practise virtue whether seen or unseen of gods and men or to be unjust and act unjustly if only unpunished and unreformed
in my judgment socrates the question has now become ridiculous
we know that when the bodily constitution is gone life is no longer endurable though pampered with all kinds of meats and drinks and having all wealth and all power and shall we be told that when the very essence of the vital principle is undermined and corrupted life is still worth having to a man if only he be allowed to do whatever he likes with the single exception that he is not to acquire justice and virtue or to escape from injustice and vice assuming them both to be such as we have described
yes i said the question is as you say ridiculous
still as we are near the spot at which we may see the truth in the clearest manner with our own eyes let us not faint by the way
certainly not he replied
come up hither i said and behold the various forms of vice those of them i mean which are worth looking at
i am following you he replied proceed
i said the argument seems to have reached a height from which as from some tower of speculation a man may look down and see that virtue is one but that the forms of vice are innumerable there being four special ones which are deserving of note
what do you mean
he said
i mean i replied that there appear to be as many forms of the soul as there are distinct forms of the state
how many
there are five of the state and five of the soul i said
what are they
the first i said is that which we have been describing and which may be said to have two names monarchy and aristocracy accordingly as rule is exercised by one distinguished man or by many
true he replied
but i regard the two names as describing one form only for whether the government is in the hands of one or many if the governors have been trained in the manner which we have supposed the fundamental laws of the state will be maintained
that is true he replied
book v
such is the good and true city or state and the good and true man is of the same pattern and if this is right every other is wrong and the evil is one which affects not only the ordering of the state but also the regulation of the individual soul and is exhibited in four forms
what are they
he said
i was proceeding to tell the order in which the four evil forms appeared to me to succeed one another when polemarchus who was sitting a little way off just beyond adeimantus began to whisper to him stretching forth his hand he took hold of the upper part of his coat by the shoulder and drew him towards him leaning forward himself so as to be quite close and saying something in his ear of which i only caught the words shall we let him off or what shall we do
certainly not said adeimantus raising his voice
who is it i said whom you are refusing to let off
you he said
i repeated why am i especially not to be let off
why he said we think that you are lazy and mean to cheat us out of a whole chapter which is a very important part of the story and you fancy that we shall not notice your airy way of proceeding as if it were self evident to everybody that in the matter of women and children friends have all things in common
and was i not right adeimantus
yes he said but what is right in this particular case like everything else requires to be explained for community may be of many kinds
please therefore to say what sort of community you mean
we have been long expecting that you would tell us something about the family life of your citizens how they will bring children into the world and rear them when they have arrived and in general what is the nature of this community of women and children for we are of opinion that the right or wrong management of such matters will have a great and paramount influence on the state for good or for evil
and now since the question is still undetermined and you are taking in hand another state we have resolved as you heard not to let you go until you give an account of all this
to that resolution said glaucon you may regard me as saying agreed
and without more ado said thrasymachus you may consider us all to be equally agreed
i said you know not what you are doing in thus assailing me what an argument are you raising about the state
just as i thought that i had finished and was only too glad that i had laid this question to sleep and was reflecting how fortunate i was in your acceptance of what i then said you ask me to begin again at the very foundation ignorant of what a hornet s nest of words you are stirring
now i foresaw this gathering trouble and avoided it
for what purpose do you conceive that we have come here said thrasymachus to look for gold or to hear discourse
yes but discourse should have a limit
yes socrates said glaucon and the whole of life is the only limit which wise men assign to the hearing of such discourses
but never mind about us take heart yourself and answer the question in your own way what sort of community of women and children is this which is to prevail among our guardians
and how shall we manage the period between birth and education which seems to require the greatest care
tell us how these things will be
yes my simple friend but the answer is the reverse of easy many more doubts arise about this than about our previous conclusions
for the practicability of what is said may be doubted and looked at in another point of view whether the scheme if ever so practicable would be for the best is also doubtful
hence i feel a reluctance to approach the subject lest our aspiration my dear friend should turn out to be a dream only
fear not he replied for your audience will not be hard upon you they are not sceptical or hostile
i said my good friend i suppose that you mean to encourage me by these words
yes he said
then let me tell you that you are doing just the reverse the encouragement which you offer would have been all very well had i myself believed that i knew what i was talking about to declare the truth about matters of high interest which a man honours and loves among wise men who love him need occasion no fear or faltering in his mind but to carry on an argument when you are yourself only a hesitating enquirer which is my condition is a dangerous and slippery thing and the danger is not that i shall be laughed at but that i shall miss the truth where i have most need to be sure of my footing and drag my friends after me in my fall
and i pray nemesis not to visit upon me the words which i am going to utter
for i do indeed believe that to be an involuntary homicide is a less crime than to be a deceiver about beauty or goodness or justice in the matter of laws
and that is a risk which i would rather run among enemies than among friends and therefore you do well to encourage me
glaucon laughed and said well then socrates in case you and your argument do us any serious injury you shall be acquitted beforehand of the homicide and shall not be held to be a deceiver take courage then and speak
well i said the law says that when a man is acquitted he is free from guilt and what holds at law may hold in argument
then why should you mind
well i replied i suppose that i must retrace my steps and say what i perhaps ought to have said before in the proper place
the part of the men has been played out and now properly enough comes the turn of the women
of them i will proceed to speak and the more readily since i am invited by you
for men born and educated like our citizens the only way in my opinion of arriving at a right conclusion about the possession and use of women and children is to follow the path on which we originally started when we said that the men were to be the guardians and watchdogs of the herd
true
let us further suppose the birth and education of our women to be subject to similar or nearly similar regulations then we shall see whether the result accords with our design
what do you mean
what i mean may be put into the form of a question i said are dogs divided into hes and shes or do they both share equally in hunting and in keeping watch and in the other duties of dogs
or do we entrust to the males the entire and exclusive care of the flocks while we leave the females at home under the idea that the bearing and suckling their puppies is labour enough for them
no he said they share alike the only difference between them is that the males are stronger and the females weaker
but can you use different animals for the same purpose unless they are bred and fed in the same way
you cannot
then if women are to have the same duties as men they must have the same nurture and education
yes
the education which was assigned to the men was music and gymnastic
yes
then women must be taught music and gymnastic and also the art of war which they must practise like the men
that is the inference i suppose
i should rather expect i said that several of our proposals if they are carried out being unusual may appear ridiculous
no doubt of it
yes and the most ridiculous thing of all will be the sight of women naked in the palaestra exercising with the men especially when they are no longer young they certainly will not be a vision of beauty any more than the enthusiastic old men who in spite of wrinkles and ugliness continue to frequent the gymnasia
yes indeed he said according to present notions the proposal would be thought ridiculous
but then i said as we have determined to speak our minds we must not fear the jests of the wits which will be directed against this sort of innovation how they will talk of women s attainments both in music and gymnastic and above all about their wearing armour and riding upon horseback
very true he replied
yet having begun we must go forward to the rough places of the law at the same time begging of these gentlemen for once in their life to be serious
not long ago as we shall remind them the hellenes were of the opinion which is still generally received among the barbarians that the sight of a naked man was ridiculous and improper and when first the cretans and then the lacedaemonians introduced the custom the wits of that day might equally have ridiculed the innovation
no doubt
but when experience showed that to let all things be uncovered was far better than to cover them up and the ludicrous effect to the outward eye vanished before the better principle which reason asserted then the man was perceived to be a fool who directs the shafts of his ridicule at any other sight but that of folly and vice or seriously inclines to weigh the beautiful by any other standard but that of the good
very true he replied
first then whether the question is to be put in jest or in earnest let us come to an understanding about the nature of woman is she capable of sharing either wholly or partially in the actions of men or not at all
and is the art of war one of those arts in which she can or can not share
that will be the best way of commencing the enquiry and will probably lead to the fairest conclusion
that will be much the best way
shall we take the other side first and begin by arguing against ourselves in this manner the adversary s position will not be undefended
why not
he said
then let us put a speech into the mouths of our opponents
they will say socrates and glaucon no adversary need convict you for you yourselves at the first foundation of the state admitted the principle that everybody was to do the one work suited to his own nature
and certainly if i am not mistaken such an admission was made by us
and do not the natures of men and women differ very much indeed
and we shall reply of course they do
then we shall be asked whether the tasks assigned to men and to women should not be different and such as are agreeable to their different natures
certainly they should
but if so have you not fallen into a serious inconsistency in saying that men and women whose natures are so entirely different ought to perform the same actions
what defence will you make for us my good sir against any one who offers these objections
that is not an easy question to answer when asked suddenly and i shall and i do beg of you to draw out the case on our side
these are the objections glaucon and there are many others of a like kind which i foresaw long ago they made me afraid and reluctant to take in hand any law about the possession and nurture of women and children
by zeus he said the problem to be solved is anything but easy
why yes i said but the fact is that when a man is out of his depth whether he has fallen into a little swimming bath or into mid ocean he has to swim all the same
very true
and must not we swim and try to reach the shore we will hope that arion s dolphin or some other miraculous help may save us
i suppose so he said
well then let us see if any way of escape can be found
we acknowledged did we not
that different natures ought to have different pursuits and that men s and women s natures are different
and now what are we saying
that different natures ought to have the same pursuits this is the inconsistency which is charged upon us
precisely
verily glaucon i said glorious is the power of the art of contradiction
why do you say so
because i think that many a man falls into the practice against his will
when he thinks that he is reasoning he is really disputing just because he cannot define and divide and so know that of which he is speaking and he will pursue a merely verbal opposition in the spirit of contention and not of fair discussion
yes he replied such is very often the case but what has that to do with us and our argument
a great deal for there is certainly a danger of our getting unintentionally into a verbal opposition
in what way
why we valiantly and pugnaciously insist upon the verbal truth that different natures ought to have different pursuits but we never considered at all what was the meaning of sameness or difference of nature or why we distinguished them when we assigned different pursuits to different natures and the same to the same natures
why no he said that was never considered by us
i said suppose that by way of illustration we were to ask the question whether there is not an opposition in nature between bald men and hairy men and if this is admitted by us then if bald men are cobblers we should forbid the hairy men to be cobblers and conversely
that would be a jest he said
yes i said a jest and why
because we never meant when we constructed the state that the opposition of natures should extend to every difference but only to those differences which affected the pursuit in which the individual is engaged we should have argued for example that a physician and one who is in mind a physician may be said to have the same nature
true
whereas the physician and the carpenter have different natures
certainly
and if i said the male and female sex appear to differ in their fitness for any art or pursuit we should say that such pursuit or art ought to be assigned to one or the other of them but if the difference consists only in women bearing and men begetting children this does not amount to a proof that a woman differs from a man in respect of the sort of education she should receive and we shall therefore continue to maintain that our guardians and their wives ought to have the same pursuits
very true he said
next we shall ask our opponent how in reference to any of the pursuits or arts of civic life the nature of a woman differs from that of a man
that will be quite fair
and perhaps he like yourself will reply that to give a sufficient answer on the instant is not easy but after a little reflection there is no difficulty
yes perhaps
suppose then that we invite him to accompany us in the argument and then we may hope to show him that there is nothing peculiar in the constitution of women which would affect them in the administration of the state
by all means
let us say to him come now and we will ask you a question when you spoke of a nature gifted or not gifted in any respect did you mean to say that one man will acquire a thing easily another with difficulty a little learning will lead the one to discover a great deal whereas the other after much study and application no sooner learns than he forgets or again did you mean that the one has a body which is a good servant to his mind while the body of the other is a hindrance to him
would not these be the sort of differences which distinguish the man gifted by nature from the one who is ungifted
no one will deny that
and can you mention any pursuit of mankind in which the male sex has not all these gifts and qualities in a higher degree than the female
need i waste time in speaking of the art of weaving and the management of pancakes and preserves in which womankind does really appear to be great and in which for her to be beaten by a man is of all things the most absurd
you are quite right he replied in maintaining the general inferiority of the female sex although many women are in many things superior to many men yet on the whole what you say is true
and if so my friend i said there is no special faculty of administration in a state which a woman has because she is a woman or which a man has by virtue of his sex but the gifts of nature are alike diffused in both all the pursuits of men are the pursuits of women also but in all of them a woman is inferior to a man
very true
then are we to impose all our enactments on men and none of them on women
that will never do
one woman has a gift of healing another not one is a musician and another has no music in her nature
very true
and one woman has a turn for gymnastic and military exercises and another is unwarlike and hates gymnastics
certainly
and one woman is a philosopher and another is an enemy of philosophy one has spirit and another is without spirit
that is also true
then one woman will have the temper of a guardian and another not
was not the selection of the male guardians determined by differences of this sort
yes
men and women alike possess the qualities which make a guardian they differ only in their comparative strength or weakness
obviously
and those women who have such qualities are to be selected as the companions and colleagues of men who have similar qualities and whom they resemble in capacity and in character
very true
and ought not the same natures to have the same pursuits
they ought
then as we were saying before there is nothing unnatural in assigning music and gymnastic to the wives of the guardians to that point we come round again
certainly not
the law which we then enacted was agreeable to nature and therefore not an impossibility or mere aspiration and the contrary practice which prevails at present is in reality a violation of nature
that appears to be true
we had to consider first whether our proposals were possible and secondly whether they were the most beneficial
yes
and the possibility has been acknowledged
yes
the very great benefit has next to be established
quite so
you will admit that the same education which makes a man a good guardian will make a woman a good guardian for their original nature is the same
yes
i should like to ask you a question
what is it
would you say that all men are equal in excellence or is one man better than another
the latter
and in the commonwealth which we were founding do you conceive the guardians who have been brought up on our model system to be more perfect men or the cobblers whose education has been cobbling
what a ridiculous question
you have answered me i replied well and may we not further say that our guardians are the best of our citizens
by far the best
and will not their wives be the best women
yes by far the best
and can there be anything better for the interests of the state than that the men and women of a state should be as good as possible
there can be nothing better
and this is what the arts of music and gymnastic when present in such manner as we have described will accomplish
certainly
then we have made an enactment not only possible but in the highest degree beneficial to the state
true
then let the wives of our guardians strip for their virtue will be their robe and let them share in the toils of war and the defence of their country only in the distribution of labours the lighter are to be assigned to the women who are the weaker natures but in other respects their duties are to be the same
and as for the man who laughs at naked women exercising their bodies from the best of motives in his laughter he is plucking a fruit of unripe wisdom and he himself is ignorant of what he is laughing at or what he is about for that is and ever will be the best of sayings that the useful is the noble and the hurtful is the base
very true
here then is one difficulty in our law about women which we may say that we have now escaped the wave has not swallowed us up alive for enacting that the guardians of either sex should have all their pursuits in common to the utility and also to the possibility of this arrangement the consistency of the argument with itself bears witness
yes that was a mighty wave which you have escaped
yes i said but a greater is coming you will not think much of this when you see the next
go on let me see
the law i said which is the sequel of this and of all that has preceded is to the following effect that the wives of our guardians are to be common and their children are to be common and no parent is to know his own child nor any child his parent
yes he said that is a much greater wave than the other and the possibility as well as the utility of such a law are far more questionable
i do not think i said that there can be any dispute about the very great utility of having wives and children in common the possibility is quite another matter and will be very much disputed
i think that a good many doubts may be raised about both
you imply that the two questions must be combined i replied
now i meant that you should admit the utility and in this way as i thought i should escape from one of them and then there would remain only the possibility
but that little attempt is detected and therefore you will please to give a defence of both
well i said i submit to my fate
yet grant me a little favour let me feast my mind with the dream as day dreamers are in the habit of feasting themselves when they are walking alone for before they have discovered any means of effecting their wishes that is a matter which never troubles them they would rather not tire themselves by thinking about possibilities but assuming that what they desire is already granted to them they proceed with their plan and delight in detailing what they mean to do when their wish has come true that is a way which they have of not doing much good to a capacity which was never good for much
now i myself am beginning to lose heart and i should like with your permission to pass over the question of possibility at present
assuming therefore the possibility of the proposal i shall now proceed to enquire how the rulers will carry out these arrangements and i shall demonstrate that our plan if executed will be of the greatest benefit to the state and to the guardians
first of all then if you have no objection i will endeavour with your help to consider the advantages of the measure and hereafter the question of possibility
i have no objection proceed
first i think that if our rulers and their auxiliaries are to be worthy of the name which they bear there must be willingness to obey in the one and the power of command in the other the guardians must themselves obey the laws and they must also imitate the spirit of them in any details which are entrusted to their care
that is right he said
you i said who are their legislator having selected the men will now select the women and give them to them they must be as far as possible of like natures with them and they must live in common houses and meet at common meals
none of them will have anything specially his or her own they will be together and will be brought up together and will associate at gymnastic exercises
and so they will be drawn by a necessity of their natures to have intercourse with each other necessity is not too strong a word i think
yes he said necessity not geometrical but another sort of necessity which lovers know and which is far more convincing and constraining to the mass of mankind
true i said and this glaucon like all the rest must proceed after an orderly fashion in a city of the blessed licentiousness is an unholy thing which the rulers will forbid
yes he said and it ought not to be permitted
then clearly the next thing will be to make matrimony sacred in the highest degree and what is most beneficial will be deemed sacred
exactly
and how can marriages be made most beneficial
that is a question which i put to you because i see in your house dogs for hunting and of the nobler sort of birds not a few
now i beseech you do tell me have you ever attended to their pairing and breeding
in what particulars
why in the first place although they are all of a good sort are not some better than others
true
and do you breed from them all indifferently or do you take care to breed from the best only
from the best
and do you take the oldest or the youngest or only those of ripe age
i choose only those of ripe age
and if care was not taken in the breeding your dogs and birds would greatly deteriorate
certainly
and the same of horses and animals in general
undoubtedly
good heavens
my dear friend i said what consummate skill will our rulers need if the same principle holds of the human species
certainly the same principle holds but why does this involve any particular skill
because i said our rulers will often have to practise upon the body corporate with medicines
now you know that when patients do not require medicines but have only to be put under a regimen the inferior sort of practitioner is deemed to be good enough but when medicine has to be given then the doctor should be more of a man
that is quite true he said but to what are you alluding
i mean i replied that our rulers will find a considerable dose of falsehood and deceit necessary for the good of their subjects we were saying that the use of all these things regarded as medicines might be of advantage
and we were very right
and this lawful use of them seems likely to be often needed in the regulations of marriages and births
how so
why i said the principle has been already laid down that the best of either sex should be united with the best as often and the inferior with the inferior as seldom as possible and that they should rear the offspring of the one sort of union but not of the other if the flock is to be maintained in first rate condition
now these goings on must be a secret which the rulers only know or there will be a further danger of our herd as the guardians may be termed breaking out into rebellion
very true
had we not better appoint certain festivals at which we will bring together the brides and bridegrooms and sacrifices will be offered and suitable hymeneal songs composed by our poets the number of weddings is a matter which must be left to the discretion of the rulers whose aim will be to preserve the average of population
there are many other things which they will have to consider such as the effects of wars and diseases and any similar agencies in order as far as this is possible to prevent the state from becoming either too large or too small
certainly he replied
we shall have to invent some ingenious kind of lots which the less worthy may draw on each occasion of our bringing them together and then they will accuse their own ill luck and not the rulers
to be sure he said
and i think that our braver and better youth besides their other honours and rewards might have greater facilities of intercourse with women given them their bravery will be a reason and such fathers ought to have as many sons as possible
true
and the proper officers whether male or female or both for offices are to be held by women as well as by men yes the proper officers will take the offspring of the good parents to the pen or fold and there they will deposit them with certain nurses who dwell in a separate quarter but the offspring of the inferior or of the better when they chance to be deformed will be put away in some mysterious unknown place as they should be
yes he said that must be done if the breed of the guardians is to be kept pure
they will provide for their nurture and will bring the mothers to the fold when they are full of milk taking the greatest possible care that no mother recognises her own child and other wet nurses may be engaged if more are required
care will also be taken that the process of suckling shall not be protracted too long and the mothers will have no getting up at night or other trouble but will hand over all this sort of thing to the nurses and attendants
you suppose the wives of our guardians to have a fine easy time of it when they are having children
why said i and so they ought
let us however proceed with our scheme
we were saying that the parents should be in the prime of life
very true
and what is the prime of life
may it not be defined as a period of about twenty years in a woman s life and thirty in a man s
which years do you mean to include
a woman i said at twenty years of age may begin to bear children to the state and continue to bear them until forty a man may begin at five and twenty when he has passed the point at which the pulse of life beats quickest and continue to beget children until he be fifty five
certainly he said both in men and women those years are the prime of physical as well as of intellectual vigour
any one above or below the prescribed ages who takes part in the public hymeneals shall be said to have done an unholy and unrighteous thing the child of which he is the father if it steals into life will have been conceived under auspices very unlike the sacrifices and prayers which at each hymeneal priestesses and priest and the whole city will offer that the new generation may be better and more useful than their good and useful parents whereas his child will be the offspring of darkness and strange lust
very true he replied
and the same law will apply to any one of those within the prescribed age who forms a connection with any woman in the prime of life without the sanction of the rulers for we shall say that he is raising up a bastard to the state uncertified and unconsecrated
very true he replied
this applies however only to those who are within the specified age after that we allow them to range at will except that a man may not marry his daughter or his daughter s daughter or his mother or his mother s mother and women on the other hand are prohibited from marrying their sons or fathers or son s son or father s father and so on in either direction
and we grant all this accompanying the permission with strict orders to prevent any embryo which may come into being from seeing the light and if any force a way to the birth the parents must understand that the offspring of such an union cannot be maintained and arrange accordingly
that also he said is a reasonable proposition
but how will they know who are fathers and daughters and so on
they will never know
the way will be this dating from the day of the hymeneal the bridegroom who was then married will call all the male children who are born in the seventh and tenth month afterwards his sons and the female children his daughters and they will call him father and he will call their children his grandchildren and they will call the elder generation grandfathers and grandmothers
all who were begotten at the time when their fathers and mothers came together will be called their brothers and sisters and these as i was saying will be forbidden to inter marry
this however is not to be understood as an absolute prohibition of the marriage of brothers and sisters if the lot favours them and they receive the sanction of the pythian oracle the law will allow them
quite right he replied
such is the scheme glaucon according to which the guardians of our state are to have their wives and families in common
and now you would have the argument show that this community is consistent with the rest of our polity and also that nothing can be better would you not
yes certainly
shall we try to find a common basis by asking of ourselves what ought to be the chief aim of the legislator in making laws and in the organization of a state what is the greatest good and what is the greatest evil and then consider whether our previous description has the stamp of the good or of the evil
by all means
can there be any greater evil than discord and distraction and plurality where unity ought to reign
or any greater good than the bond of unity
there cannot
and there is unity where there is community of pleasures and pains where all the citizens are glad or grieved on the same occasions of joy and sorrow
no doubt
yes and where there is no common but only private feeling a state is disorganized when you have one half of the world triumphing and the other plunged in grief at the same events happening to the city or the citizens
certainly
such differences commonly originate in a disagreement about the use of the terms mine and not mine his and not his
exactly so
and is not that the best ordered state in which the greatest number of persons apply the terms mine and not mine in the same way to the same thing
quite true
or that again which most nearly approaches to the condition of the individual as in the body when but a finger of one of us is hurt the whole frame drawn towards the soul as a centre and forming one kingdom under the ruling power therein feels the hurt and sympathizes all together with the part affected and we say that the man has a pain in his finger and the same expression is used about any other part of the body which has a sensation of pain at suffering or of pleasure at the alleviation of suffering
very true he replied and i agree with you that in the best ordered state there is the nearest approach to this common feeling which you describe
then when any one of the citizens experiences any good or evil the whole state will make his case their own and will either rejoice or sorrow with him
yes he said that is what will happen in a well ordered state
it will now be time i said for us to return to our state and see whether this or some other form is most in accordance with these fundamental principles
very good
our state like every other has rulers and subjects
true
all of whom will call one another citizens
of course
but is there not another name which people give to their rulers in other states
generally they call them masters but in democratic states they simply call them rulers
and in our state what other name besides that of citizens do the people give the rulers
they are called saviours and helpers he replied
and what do the rulers call the people
their maintainers and foster fathers
and what do they call them in other states
slaves
and what do the rulers call one another in other states
fellow rulers
and what in ours
fellow guardians
did you ever know an example in any other state of a ruler who would speak of one of his colleagues as his friend and of another as not being his friend
yes very often
and the friend he regards and describes as one in whom he has an interest and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest
exactly
but would any of your guardians think or speak of any other guardian as a stranger
certainly he would not for every one whom they meet will be regarded by them either as a brother or sister or father or mother or son or daughter or as the child or parent of those who are thus connected with him
capital i said but let me ask you once more shall they be a family in name only or shall they in all their actions be true to the name
for example in the use of the word father would the care of a father be implied and the filial reverence and duty and obedience to him which the law commands and is the violator of these duties to be regarded as an impious and unrighteous person who is not likely to receive much good either at the hands of god or of man
are these to be or not to be the strains which the children will hear repeated in their ears by all the citizens about those who are intimated to them to be their parents and the rest of their kinsfolk
these he said and none other for what can be more ridiculous than for them to utter the names of family ties with the lips only and not to act in the spirit of them
then in our city the language of harmony and concord will be more often heard than in any other
as i was describing before when any one is well or ill the universal word will be with me it is well or it is ill
most true
and agreeably to this mode of thinking and speaking were we not saying that they will have their pleasures and pains in common
yes and so they will
and they will have a common interest in the same thing which they will alike call my own and having this common interest they will have a common feeling of pleasure and pain
yes far more so than in other states
and the reason of this over and above the general constitution of the state will be that the guardians will have a community of women and children
that will be the chief reason
and this unity of feeling we admitted to be the greatest good as was implied in our own comparison of a well ordered state to the relation of the body and the members when affected by pleasure or pain
that we acknowledged and very rightly
then the community of wives and children among our citizens is clearly the source of the greatest good to the state
certainly
and this agrees with the other principle which we were affirming that the guardians were not to have houses or lands or any other property their pay was to be their food which they were to receive from the other citizens and they were to have no private expenses for we intended them to preserve their true character of guardians
right he replied
both the community of property and the community of families as i am saying tend to make them more truly guardians they will not tear the city in pieces by differing about mine and not mine each man dragging any acquisition which he has made into a separate house of his own where he has a separate wife and children and private pleasures and pains but all will be affected as far as may be by the same pleasures and pains because they are all of one opinion about what is near and dear to them and therefore they all tend towards a common end
certainly he replied
and as they have nothing but their persons which they can call their own suits and complaints will have no existence among them they will be delivered from all those quarrels of which money or children or relations are the occasion
of course they will
neither will trials for assault or insult ever be likely to occur among them
for that equals should defend themselves against equals we shall maintain to be honourable and right we shall make the protection of the person a matter of necessity
that is good he said
yes and there is a further good in the law viz
that if a man has a quarrel with another he will satisfy his resentment then and there and not proceed to more dangerous lengths
certainly
to the elder shall be assigned the duty of ruling and chastising the younger
clearly
nor can there be a doubt that the younger will not strike or do any other violence to an elder unless the magistrates command him nor will he slight him in any way
for there are two guardians shame and fear mighty to prevent him shame which makes men refrain from laying hands on those who are to them in the relation of parents fear that the injured one will be succoured by the others who are his brothers sons fathers
that is true he replied
then in every way the laws will help the citizens to keep the peace with one another
yes there will be no want of peace
and as the guardians will never quarrel among themselves there will be no danger of the rest of the city being divided either against them or against one another
none whatever
i hardly like even to mention the little meannesses of which they will be rid for they are beneath notice such for example as the flattery of the rich by the poor and all the pains and pangs which men experience in bringing up a family and in finding money to buy necessaries for their household borrowing and then repudiating getting how they can and giving the money into the hands of women and slaves to keep the many evils of so many kinds which people suffer in this way are mean enough and obvious enough and not worth speaking of
yes he said a man has no need of eyes in order to perceive that
and from all these evils they will be delivered and their life will be blessed as the life of olympic victors and yet more blessed
how so
the olympic victor i said is deemed happy in receiving a part only of the blessedness which is secured to our citizens who have won a more glorious victory and have a more complete maintenance at the public cost
for the victory which they have won is the salvation of the whole state and the crown with which they and their children are crowned is the fulness of all that life needs they receive rewards from the hands of their country while living and after death have an honourable burial
yes he said and glorious rewards they are
do you remember i said how in the course of the previous discussion some one who shall be nameless accused us of making our guardians unhappy they had nothing and might have possessed all things to whom we replied that if an occasion offered we might perhaps hereafter consider this question but that as at present advised we would make our guardians truly guardians and that we were fashioning the state with a view to the greatest happiness not of any particular class but of the whole
yes i remember
and what do you say now that the life of our protectors is made out to be far better and nobler than that of olympic victors is the life of shoemakers or any other artisans or of husbandmen to be compared with it
certainly not
at the same time i ought here to repeat what i have said elsewhere that if any of our guardians shall try to be happy in such a manner that he will cease to be a guardian and is not content with this safe and harmonious life which in our judgment is of all lives the best but infatuated by some youthful conceit of happiness which gets up into his head shall seek to appropriate the whole state to himself then he will have to learn how wisely hesiod spoke when he said half is more than the whole
if he were to consult me i should say to him stay where you are when you have the offer of such a life
you agree then i said that men and women are to have a common way of life such as we have described common education common children and they are to watch over the citizens in common whether abiding in the city or going out to war they are to keep watch together and to hunt together like dogs and always and in all things as far as they are able women are to share with the men
and in so doing they will do what is best and will not violate but preserve the natural relation of the sexes
i agree with you he replied
the enquiry i said has yet to be made whether such a community be found possible as among other animals so also among men and if possible in what way possible
you have anticipated the question which i was about to suggest
there is no difficulty i said in seeing how war will be carried on by them
how
why of course they will go on expeditions together and will take with them any of their children who are strong enough that after the manner of the artisan s child they may look on at the work which they will have to do when they are grown up and besides looking on they will have to help and be of use in war and to wait upon their fathers and mothers
did you never observe in the arts how the potters boys look on and help long before they touch the wheel
yes i have
and shall potters be more careful in educating their children and in giving them the opportunity of seeing and practising their duties than our guardians will be
the idea is ridiculous he said
there is also the effect on the parents with whom as with other animals the presence of their young ones will be the greatest incentive to valour
that is quite true socrates and yet if they are defeated which may often happen in war how great the danger is
the children will be lost as well as their parents and the state will never recover
true i said but would you never allow them to run any risk
i am far from saying that
well but if they are ever to run a risk should they not do so on some occasion when if they escape disaster they will be the better for it
clearly
whether the future soldiers do or do not see war in the days of their youth is a very important matter for the sake of which some risk may fairly be incurred
yes very important
this then must be our first step to make our children spectators of war but we must also contrive that they shall be secured against danger then all will be well
true
their parents may be supposed not to be blind to the risks of war but to know as far as human foresight can what expeditions are safe and what dangerous
that may be assumed
and they will take them on the safe expeditions and be cautious about the dangerous ones
true
and they will place them under the command of experienced veterans who will be their leaders and teachers
very properly
still the dangers of war cannot be always foreseen there is a good deal of chance about them
true
then against such chances the children must be at once furnished with wings in order that in the hour of need they may fly away and escape
what do you mean
he said
i mean that we must mount them on horses in their earliest youth and when they have learnt to ride take them on horseback to see war the horses must not be spirited and warlike but the most tractable and yet the swiftest that can be had
in this way they will get an excellent view of what is hereafter to be their own business and if there is danger they have only to follow their elder leaders and escape
i believe that you are right he said
next as to war what are to be the relations of your soldiers to one another and to their enemies
i should be inclined to propose that the soldier who leaves his rank or throws away his arms or is guilty of any other act of cowardice should be degraded into the rank of a husbandman or artisan
what do you think
by all means i should say
and he who allows himself to be taken prisoner may as well be made a present of to his enemies he is their lawful prey and let them do what they like with him
certainly
but the hero who has distinguished himself what shall be done to him
in the first place he shall receive honour in the army from his youthful comrades every one of them in succession shall crown him
what do you say
i approve
and what do you say to his receiving the right hand of fellowship
to that too i agree
but you will hardly agree to my next proposal
what is your proposal
that he should kiss and be kissed by them
most certainly and i should be disposed to go further and say let no one whom he has a mind to kiss refuse to be kissed by him while the expedition lasts
so that if there be a lover in the army whether his love be youth or maiden he may be more eager to win the prize of valour
capital i said
that the brave man is to have more wives than others has been already determined and he is to have first choices in such matters more than others in order that he may have as many children as possible
agreed
again there is another manner in which according to homer brave youths should be honoured for he tells how ajax after he had distinguished himself in battle was rewarded with long chines which seems to be a compliment appropriate to a hero in the flower of his age being not only a tribute of honour but also a very strengthening thing
most true he said
then in this i said homer shall be our teacher and we too at sacrifices and on the like occasions will honour the brave according to the measure of their valour whether men or women with hymns and those other distinctions which we were mentioning also with seats of precedence and meats and full cups and in honouring them we shall be at the same time training them
that he replied is excellent
yes i said and when a man dies gloriously in war shall we not say in the first place that he is of the golden race
to be sure
nay have we not the authority of hesiod for affirming that when they are dead they are holy angels upon the earth authors of good averters of evil the guardians of speech gifted men 
yes and we accept his authority
we must learn of the god how we are to order the sepulture of divine and heroic personages and what is to be their special distinction and we must do as he bids
by all means
and in ages to come we will reverence them and kneel before their sepulchres as at the graves of heroes
and not only they but any who are deemed pre eminently good whether they die from age or in any other way shall be admitted to the same honours
that is very right he said
next how shall our soldiers treat their enemies
what about this
in what respect do you mean
first of all in regard to slavery
do you think it right that hellenes should enslave hellenic states or allow others to enslave them if they can help
should not their custom be to spare them considering the danger which there is that the whole race may one day fall under the yoke of the barbarians
to spare them is infinitely better
then no hellene should be owned by them as a slave that is a rule which they will observe and advise the other hellenes to observe
certainly he said they will in this way be united against the barbarians and will keep their hands off one another
next as to the slain ought the conquerors i said to take anything but their armour
does not the practice of despoiling an enemy afford an excuse for not facing the battle
cowards skulk about the dead pretending that they are fulfilling a duty and many an army before now has been lost from this love of plunder
very true
and is there not illiberality and avarice in robbing a corpse and also a degree of meanness and womanishness in making an enemy of the dead body when the real enemy has flown away and left only his fighting gear behind him is not this rather like a dog who cannot get at his assailant quarrelling with the stones which strike him instead
very like a dog he said
then we must abstain from spoiling the dead or hindering their burial
yes he replied we most certainly must
neither shall we offer up arms at the temples of the gods least of all the arms of hellenes if we care to maintain good feeling with other hellenes and indeed we have reason to fear that the offering of spoils taken from kinsmen may be a pollution unless commanded by the god himself
very true
again as to the devastation of hellenic territory or the burning of houses what is to be the practice
may i have the pleasure he said of hearing your opinion
both should be forbidden in my judgment i would take the annual produce and no more
shall i tell you why
pray do
why you see there is a difference in the names discord and war and i imagine that there is also a difference in their natures the one is expressive of what is internal and domestic the other of what is external and foreign and the first of the two is termed discord and only the second war
that is a very proper distinction he replied
and may i not observe with equal propriety that the hellenic race is all united together by ties of blood and friendship and alien and strange to the barbarians
very good he said
and therefore when hellenes fight with barbarians and barbarians with hellenes they will be described by us as being at war when they fight and by nature enemies and this kind of antagonism should be called war but when hellenes fight with one another we shall say that hellas is then in a state of disorder and discord they being by nature friends and such enmity is to be called discord
i agree
consider then i said when that which we have acknowledged to be discord occurs and a city is divided if both parties destroy the lands and burn the houses of one another how wicked does the strife appear
no true lover of his country would bring himself to tear in pieces his own nurse and mother there might be reason in the conqueror depriving the conquered of their harvest but still they would have the idea of peace in their hearts and would not mean to go on fighting for ever
yes he said that is a better temper than the other
and will not the city which you are founding be an hellenic city
it ought to be he replied
then will not the citizens be good and civilized
yes very civilized
and will they not be lovers of hellas and think of hellas as their own land and share in the common temples
most certainly
and any difference which arises among them will be regarded by them as discord only a quarrel among friends which is not to be called a war
certainly not
then they will quarrel as those who intend some day to be reconciled
certainly
they will use friendly correction but will not enslave or destroy their opponents they will be correctors not enemies
just so
and as they are hellenes themselves they will not devastate hellas nor will they burn houses nor ever suppose that the whole population of a city men women and children are equally their enemies for they know that the guilt of war is always confined to a few persons and that the many are their friends
and for all these reasons they will be unwilling to waste their lands and rase their houses their enmity to them will only last until the many innocent sufferers have compelled the guilty few to give satisfaction
i agree he said that our citizens should thus deal with their hellenic enemies and with barbarians as the hellenes now deal with one another
then let us enact this law also for our guardians that they are neither to devastate the lands of hellenes nor to burn their houses
agreed and we may agree also in thinking that these like all our previous enactments are very good
but still i must say socrates that if you are allowed to go on in this way you will entirely forget the other question which at the commencement of this discussion you thrust aside is such an order of things possible and how if at all
for i am quite ready to acknowledge that the plan which you propose if only feasible would do all sorts of good to the state
i will add what you have omitted that your citizens will be the bravest of warriors and will never leave their ranks for they will all know one another and each will call the other father brother son and if you suppose the women to join their armies whether in the same rank or in the rear either as a terror to the enemy or as auxiliaries in case of need i know that they will then be absolutely invincible and there are many domestic advantages which might also be mentioned and which i also fully acknowledge but as i admit all these advantages and as many more as you please if only this state of yours were to come into existence we need say no more about them assuming then the existence of the state let us now turn to the question of possibility and ways and means the rest may be left
if i loiter for a moment you instantly make a raid upon me i said and have no mercy i have hardly escaped the first and second waves and you seem not to be aware that you are now bringing upon me the third which is the greatest and heaviest
when you have seen and heard the third wave i think you will be more considerate and will acknowledge that some fear and hesitation was natural respecting a proposal so extraordinary as that which i have now to state and investigate
the more appeals of this sort which you make he said the more determined are we that you shall tell us how such a state is possible speak out and at once
let me begin by reminding you that we found our way hither in the search after justice and injustice
true he replied but what of that
i was only going to ask whether if we have discovered them we are to require that the just man should in nothing fail of absolute justice or may we be satisfied with an approximation and the attainment in him of a higher degree of justice than is to be found in other men
the approximation will be enough
we were enquiring into the nature of absolute justice and into the character of the perfectly just and into injustice and the perfectly unjust that we might have an ideal
we were to look at these in order that we might judge of our own happiness and unhappiness according to the standard which they exhibited and the degree in which we resembled them but not with any view of showing that they could exist in fact
true he said
would a painter be any the worse because after having delineated with consummate art an ideal of a perfectly beautiful man he was unable to show that any such man could ever have existed
he would be none the worse
well and were we not creating an ideal of a perfect state
to be sure
and is our theory a worse theory because we are unable to prove the possibility of a city being ordered in the manner described
surely not he replied
that is the truth i said
but if at your request i am to try and show how and under what conditions the possibility is highest i must ask you having this in view to repeat your former admissions
what admissions
i want to know whether ideals are ever fully realized in language
does not the word express more than the fact and must not the actual whatever a man may think always in the nature of things fall short of the truth
what do you say
i agree
then you must not insist on my proving that the actual state will in every respect coincide with the ideal if we are only able to discover how a city may be governed nearly as we proposed you will admit that we have discovered the possibility which you demand and will be contented
i am sure that i should be contented will not you
yes i will
let me next endeavour to show what is that fault in states which is the cause of their present maladministration and what is the least change which will enable a state to pass into the truer form and let the change if possible be of one thing only or if not of two at any rate let the changes be as few and slight as possible
certainly he replied
i think i said that there might be a reform of the state if only one change were made which is not a slight or easy though still a possible one
what is it
he said
now then i said i go to meet that which i liken to the greatest of the waves yet shall the word be spoken even though the wave break and drown me in laughter and dishonour and do you mark my words
proceed
i said until philosophers are kings or the kings and princes of this world have the spirit and power of philosophy and political greatness and wisdom meet in one and those commoner natures who pursue either to the exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside cities will never have rest from their evils nor the human race as i believe and then only will this our state have a possibility of life and behold the light of day
such was the thought my dear glaucon which i would fain have uttered if it had not seemed too extravagant for to be convinced that in no other state can there be happiness private or public is indeed a hard thing
socrates what do you mean
i would have you consider that the word which you have uttered is one at which numerous persons and very respectable persons too in a figure pulling off their coats all in a moment and seizing any weapon that comes to hand will run at you might and main before you know where you are intending to do heaven knows what and if you don t prepare an answer and put yourself in motion you will be pared by their fine wits and no mistake
you got me into the scrape i said
and i was quite right however i will do all i can to get you out of it but i can only give you good will and good advice and perhaps i may be able to fit answers to your questions better than another that is all
and now having such an auxiliary you must do your best to show the unbelievers that you are right
i ought to try i said since you offer me such invaluable assistance
and i think that if there is to be a chance of our escaping we must explain to them whom we mean when we say that philosophers are to rule in the state then we shall be able to defend ourselves there will be discovered to be some natures who ought to study philosophy and to be leaders in the state and others who are not born to be philosophers and are meant to be followers rather than leaders
then now for a definition he said
follow me i said and i hope that i may in some way or other be able to give you a satisfactory explanation
proceed
i dare say that you remember and therefore i need not remind you that a lover if he is worthy of the name ought to show his love not to some one part of that which he loves but to the whole
i really do not understand and therefore beg of you to assist my memory
another person i said might fairly reply as you do but a man of pleasure like yourself ought to know that all who are in the flower of youth do somehow or other raise a pang or emotion in a lover s breast and are thought by him to be worthy of his affectionate regards
is not this a way which you have with the fair one has a snub nose and you praise his charming face the hook nose of another has you say a royal look while he who is neither snub nor hooked has the grace of regularity the dark visage is manly the fair are children of the gods and as to the sweet honey pale as they are called what is the very name but the invention of a lover who talks in diminutives and is not averse to paleness if appearing on the cheek of youth
in a word there is no excuse which you will not make and nothing which you will not say in order not to lose a single flower that blooms in the spring time of youth
if you make me an authority in matters of love for the sake of the argument i assent
and what do you say of lovers of wine
do you not see them doing the same
they are glad of any pretext of drinking any wine
very good
and the same is true of ambitious men if they cannot command an army they are willing to command a file and if they cannot be honoured by really great and important persons they are glad to be honoured by lesser and meaner people but honour of some kind they must have
exactly
once more let me ask does he who desires any class of goods desire the whole class or a part only
the whole
and may we not say of the philosopher that he is a lover not of a part of wisdom only but of the whole
yes of the whole
and he who dislikes learning especially in youth when he has no power of judging what is good and what is not such an one we maintain not to be a philosopher or a lover of knowledge just as he who refuses his food is not hungry and may be said to have a bad appetite and not a good one
very true he said
whereas he who has a taste for every sort of knowledge and who is curious to learn and is never satisfied may be justly termed a philosopher
am i not right
glaucon said if curiosity makes a philosopher you will find many a strange being will have a title to the name
all the lovers of sights have a delight in learning and must therefore be included
musical amateurs too are a folk strangely out of place among philosophers for they are the last persons in the world who would come to anything like a philosophical discussion if they could help while they run about at the dionysiac festivals as if they had let out their ears to hear every chorus whether the performance is in town or country that makes no difference they are there
now are we to maintain that all these and any who have similar tastes as well as the professors of quite minor arts are philosophers
certainly not i replied they are only an imitation
he said who then are the true philosophers
those i said who are lovers of the vision of truth
that is also good he said but i should like to know what you mean
to another i replied i might have a difficulty in explaining but i am sure that you will admit a proposition which i am about to make
what is the proposition
that since beauty is the opposite of ugliness they are two
certainly
and inasmuch as they are two each of them is one
true again
and of just and unjust good and evil and of every other class the same remark holds taken singly each of them is one but from the various combinations of them with actions and things and with one another they are seen in all sorts of lights and appear many
very true
and this is the distinction which i draw between the sight loving art loving practical class and those of whom i am speaking and who are alone worthy of the name of philosophers
how do you distinguish them
he said
the lovers of sounds and sights i replied are as i conceive fond of fine tones and colours and forms and all the artificial products that are made out of them but their mind is incapable of seeing or loving absolute beauty
true he replied
few are they who are able to attain to the sight of this
very true
and he who having a sense of beautiful things has no sense of absolute beauty or who if another lead him to a knowledge of that beauty is unable to follow of such an one i ask is he awake or in a dream only
reflect is not the dreamer sleeping or waking one who likens dissimilar things who puts the copy in the place of the real object
i should certainly say that such an one was dreaming
but take the case of the other who recognises the existence of absolute beauty and is able to distinguish the idea from the objects which participate in the idea neither putting the objects in the place of the idea nor the idea in the place of the objects is he a dreamer or is he awake
he is wide awake
and may we not say that the mind of the one who knows has knowledge and that the mind of the other who opines only has opinion
certainly
but suppose that the latter should quarrel with us and dispute our statement can we administer any soothing cordial or advice to him without revealing to him that there is sad disorder in his wits
we must certainly offer him some good advice he replied
come then and let us think of something to say to him
shall we begin by assuring him that he is welcome to any knowledge which he may have and that we are rejoiced at his having it
but we should like to ask him a question does he who has knowledge know something or nothing
i answer that he knows something
something that is or is not
something that is for how can that which is not ever be known
and are we assured after looking at the matter from many points of view that absolute being is or may be absolutely known but that the utterly non existent is utterly unknown
nothing can be more certain
good
but if there be anything which is of such a nature as to be and not to be that will have a place intermediate between pure being and the absolute negation of being
yes between them
and as knowledge corresponded to being and ignorance of necessity to not being for that intermediate between being and not being there has to be discovered a corresponding intermediate between ignorance and knowledge if there be such
certainly
do we admit the existence of opinion
undoubtedly
as being the same with knowledge or another faculty
another faculty
then opinion and knowledge have to do with different kinds of matter corresponding to this difference of faculties
yes
and knowledge is relative to being and knows being
but before i proceed further i will make a division
what division
i will begin by placing faculties in a class by themselves they are powers in us and in all other things by which we do as we do
sight and hearing for example i should call faculties
have i clearly explained the class which i mean
yes i quite understand
then let me tell you my view about them
i do not see them and therefore the distinctions of figure colour and the like which enable me to discern the differences of some things do not apply to them
in speaking of a faculty i think only of its sphere and its result and that which has the same sphere and the same result i call the same faculty but that which has another sphere and another result i call different
would that be your way of speaking
yes
and will you be so very good as to answer one more question
would you say that knowledge is a faculty or in what class would you place it
certainly knowledge is a faculty and the mightiest of all faculties
and is opinion also a faculty
certainly he said for opinion is that with which we are able to form an opinion
and yet you were acknowledging a little while ago that knowledge is not the same as opinion
why yes he said how can any reasonable being ever identify that which is infallible with that which errs
an excellent answer proving i said that we are quite conscious of a distinction between them
yes
then knowledge and opinion having distinct powers have also distinct spheres or subject matters
that is certain
being is the sphere or subject matter of knowledge and knowledge is to know the nature of being
yes
and opinion is to have an opinion
yes
and do we know what we opine
or is the subject matter of opinion the same as the subject matter of knowledge
nay he replied that has been already disproven if difference in faculty implies difference in the sphere or subject matter and if as we were saying opinion and knowledge are distinct faculties then the sphere of knowledge and of opinion cannot be the same
then if being is the subject matter of knowledge something else must be the subject matter of opinion
yes something else
well then is not being the subject matter of opinion
or rather how can there be an opinion at all about not being
reflect when a man has an opinion has he not an opinion about something
can he have an opinion which is an opinion about nothing
impossible
he who has an opinion has an opinion about some one thing
yes
and not being is not one thing but properly speaking nothing
true
of not being ignorance was assumed to be the necessary correlative of being knowledge
true he said
then opinion is not concerned either with being or with not being
not with either
and can therefore neither be ignorance nor knowledge
that seems to be true
but is opinion to be sought without and beyond either of them in a greater clearness than knowledge or in a greater darkness than ignorance
in neither
then i suppose that opinion appears to you to be darker than knowledge but lighter than ignorance
both and in no small degree
and also to be within and between them
yes
then you would infer that opinion is intermediate
no question
but were we not saying before that if anything appeared to be of a sort which is and is not at the same time that sort of thing would appear also to lie in the interval between pure being and absolute not being and that the corresponding faculty is neither knowledge nor ignorance but will be found in the interval between them
true
and in that interval there has now been discovered something which we call opinion
there has
then what remains to be discovered is the object which partakes equally of the nature of being and not being and cannot rightly be termed either pure and simple this unknown term when discovered we may truly call the subject of opinion and assign each to their proper faculty the extremes to the faculties of the extremes and the mean to the faculty of the mean
true
this being premised i would ask the gentleman who is of opinion that there is no absolute or unchangeable idea of beauty in whose opinion the beautiful is the manifold he i say your lover of beautiful sights who cannot bear to be told that the beautiful is one and the just is one or that anything is one to him i would appeal saying will you be so very kind sir as to tell us whether of all these beautiful things there is one which will not be found ugly or of the just which will not be found unjust or of the holy which will not also be unholy
no he replied the beautiful will in some point of view be found ugly and the same is true of the rest
and may not the many which are doubles be also halves
doubles that is of one thing and halves of another
quite true
and things great and small heavy and light as they are termed will not be denoted by these any more than by the opposite names
true both these and the opposite names will always attach to all of them
and can any one of those many things which are called by particular names be said to be this rather than not to be this
he replied they are like the punning riddles which are asked at feasts or the children s puzzle about the eunuch aiming at the bat with what he hit him as they say in the puzzle and upon what the bat was sitting
the individual objects of which i am speaking are also a riddle and have a double sense nor can you fix them in your mind either as being or not being or both or neither
then what will you do with them
i said
can they have a better place than between being and not being
for they are clearly not in greater darkness or negation than not being or more full of light and existence than being
that is quite true he said
thus then we seem to have discovered that the many ideas which the multitude entertain about the beautiful and about all other things are tossing about in some region which is half way between pure being and pure not being
we have
yes and we had before agreed that anything of this kind which we might find was to be described as matter of opinion and not as matter of knowledge being the intermediate flux which is caught and detained by the intermediate faculty
quite true
then those who see the many beautiful and who yet neither see absolute beauty nor can follow any guide who points the way thither who see the many just and not absolute justice and the like such persons may be said to have opinion but not knowledge
that is certain
but those who see the absolute and eternal and immutable may be said to know and not to have opinion only
neither can that be denied
the one love and embrace the subjects of knowledge the other those of opinion
the latter are the same as i dare say you will remember who listened to sweet sounds and gazed upon fair colours but would not tolerate the existence of absolute beauty
yes i remember
shall we then be guilty of any impropriety in calling them lovers of opinion rather than lovers of wisdom and will they be very angry with us for thus describing them
i shall tell them not to be angry no man should be angry at what is true
but those who love the truth in each thing are to be called lovers of wisdom and not lovers of opinion
assuredly
book vi
and thus glaucon after the argument has gone a weary way the true and the false philosophers have at length appeared in view
i do not think he said that the way could have been shortened
i suppose not i said and yet i believe that we might have had a better view of both of them if the discussion could have been confined to this one subject and if there were not many other questions awaiting us which he who desires to see in what respect the life of the just differs from that of the unjust must consider
and what is the next question
he asked
surely i said the one which follows next in order
inasmuch as philosophers only are able to grasp the eternal and unchangeable and those who wander in the region of the many and variable are not philosophers i must ask you which of the two classes should be the rulers of our state
and how can we rightly answer that question
whichever of the two are best able to guard the laws and institutions of our state let them be our guardians
very good
neither i said can there be any question that the guardian who is to keep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes
there can be no question of that
and are not those who are verily and indeed wanting in the knowledge of the true being of each thing and who have in their souls no clear pattern and are unable as with a painter s eye to look at the absolute truth and to that original to repair and having perfect vision of the other world to order the laws about beauty goodness justice in this if not already ordered and to guard and preserve the order of them are not such persons i ask simply blind
truly he replied they are much in that condition
and shall they be our guardians when there are others who besides being their equals in experience and falling short of them in no particular of virtue also know the very truth of each thing
there can be no reason he said for rejecting those who have this greatest of all great qualities they must always have the first place unless they fail in some other respect
suppose then i said that we determine how far they can unite this and the other excellences
by all means
in the first place as we began by observing the nature of the philosopher has to be ascertained
we must come to an understanding about him and when we have done so then if i am not mistaken we shall also acknowledge that such an union of qualities is possible and that those in whom they are united and those only should be rulers in the state
what do you mean
let us suppose that philosophical minds always love knowledge of a sort which shows them the eternal nature not varying from generation and corruption
agreed
and further i said let us agree that they are lovers of all true being there is no part whether greater or less or more or less honourable which they are willing to renounce as we said before of the lover and the man of ambition
true
and if they are to be what we were describing is there not another quality which they should also possess
what quality
truthfulness they will never intentionally receive into their mind falsehood which is their detestation and they will love the truth
yes that may be safely affirmed of them
may be my friend i replied is not the word say rather must be affirmed for he whose nature is amorous of anything cannot help loving all that belongs or is akin to the object of his affections
right he said
and is there anything more akin to wisdom than truth
how can there be
can the same nature be a lover of wisdom and a lover of falsehood
never
the true lover of learning then must from his earliest youth as far as in him lies desire all truth
assuredly
but then again as we know by experience he whose desires are strong in one direction will have them weaker in others they will be like a stream which has been drawn off into another channel
true
he whose desires are drawn towards knowledge in every form will be absorbed in the pleasures of the soul and will hardly feel bodily pleasure i mean if he be a true philosopher and not a sham one
that is most certain
such an one is sure to be temperate and the reverse of covetous for the motives which make another man desirous of having and spending have no place in his character
very true
another criterion of the philosophical nature has also to be considered
what is that
there should be no secret corner of illiberality nothing can be more antagonistic than meanness to a soul which is ever longing after the whole of things both divine and human
most true he replied
then how can he who has magnificence of mind and is the spectator of all time and all existence think much of human life
he cannot
or can such an one account death fearful
no indeed
then the cowardly and mean nature has no part in true philosophy
certainly not
or again can he who is harmoniously constituted who is not covetous or mean or a boaster or a coward can he i say ever be unjust or hard in his dealings
impossible
then you will soon observe whether a man is just and gentle or rude and unsociable these are the signs which distinguish even in youth the philosophical nature from the unphilosophical
true
there is another point which should be remarked
what point
whether he has or has not a pleasure in learning for no one will love that which gives him pain and in which after much toil he makes little progress
certainly not
and again if he is forgetful and retains nothing of what he learns will he not be an empty vessel
that is certain
labouring in vain he must end in hating himself and his fruitless occupation
yes
then a soul which forgets cannot be ranked among genuine philosophic natures we must insist that the philosopher should have a good memory
certainly
and once more the inharmonious and unseemly nature can only tend to disproportion
undoubtedly
and do you consider truth to be akin to proportion or to disproportion
to proportion
then besides other qualities we must try to find a naturally well proportioned and gracious mind which will move spontaneously towards the true being of everything
certainly
well and do not all these qualities which we have been enumerating go together and are they not in a manner necessary to a soul which is to have a full and perfect participation of being
they are absolutely necessary he replied
and must not that be a blameless study which he only can pursue who has the gift of a good memory and is quick to learn noble gracious the friend of truth justice courage temperance who are his kindred
the god of jealousy himself he said could find no fault with such a study
and to men like him i said when perfected by years and education and to these only you will entrust the state
here adeimantus interposed and said to these statements socrates no one can offer a reply but when you talk in this way a strange feeling passes over the minds of your hearers they fancy that they are led astray a little at each step in the argument owing to their own want of skill in asking and answering questions these littles accumulate and at the end of the discussion they are found to have sustained a mighty overthrow and all their former notions appear to be turned upside down
and as unskilful players of draughts are at last shut up by their more skilful adversaries and have no piece to move so they too find themselves shut up at last for they have nothing to say in this new game of which words are the counters and yet all the time they are in the right
the observation is suggested to me by what is now occurring
for any one of us might say that although in words he is not able to meet you at each step of the argument he sees as a fact that the votaries of philosophy when they carry on the study not only in youth as a part of education but as the pursuit of their maturer years most of them become strange monsters not to say utter rogues and that those who may be considered the best of them are made useless to the world by the very study which you extol
well and do you think that those who say so are wrong
i cannot tell he replied but i should like to know what is your opinion
hear my answer i am of opinion that they are quite right
then how can you be justified in saying that cities will not cease from evil until philosophers rule in them when philosophers are acknowledged by us to be of no use to them
you ask a question i said to which a reply can only be given in a parable
yes socrates and that is a way of speaking to which you are not at all accustomed i suppose
i perceive i said that you are vastly amused at having plunged me into such a hopeless discussion but now hear the parable and then you will be still more amused at the meagreness of my imagination for the manner in which the best men are treated in their own states is so grievous that no single thing on earth is comparable to it and therefore if i am to plead their cause i must have recourse to fiction and put together a figure made up of many things like the fabulous unions of goats and stags which are found in pictures
imagine then a fleet or a ship in which there is a captain who is taller and stronger than any of the crew but he is a little deaf and has a similar infirmity in sight and his knowledge of navigation is not much better
the sailors are quarrelling with one another about the steering every one is of opinion that he has a right to steer though he has never learned the art of navigation and cannot tell who taught him or when he learned and will further assert that it cannot be taught and they are ready to cut in pieces any one who says the contrary
they throng about the captain begging and praying him to commit the helm to them and if at any time they do not prevail but others are preferred to them they kill the others or throw them overboard and having first chained up the noble captain s senses with drink or some narcotic drug they mutiny and take possession of the ship and make free with the stores thus eating and drinking they proceed on their voyage in such manner as might be expected of them
him who is their partisan and cleverly aids them in their plot for getting the ship out of the captain s hands into their own whether by force or persuasion they compliment with the name of sailor pilot able seaman and abuse the other sort of man whom they call a good for nothing but that the true pilot must pay attention to the year and seasons and sky and stars and winds and whatever else belongs to his art if he intends to be really qualified for the command of a ship and that he must and will be the steerer whether other people like or not the possibility of this union of authority with the steerer s art has never seriously entered into their thoughts or been made part of their calling
now in vessels which are in a state of mutiny and by sailors who are mutineers how will the true pilot be regarded
will he not be called by them a prater a star gazer a good for nothing
of course said adeimantus
then you will hardly need i said to hear the interpretation of the figure which describes the true philosopher in his relation to the state for you understand already
certainly
then suppose you now take this parable to the gentleman who is surprised at finding that philosophers have no honour in their cities explain it to him and try to convince him that their having honour would be far more extraordinary
i will
say to him that in deeming the best votaries of philosophy to be useless to the rest of the world he is right but also tell him to attribute their uselessness to the fault of those who will not use them and not to themselves
the pilot should not humbly beg the sailors to be commanded by him that is not the order of nature neither are the wise to go to the doors of the rich the ingenious author of this saying told a lie but the truth is that when a man is ill whether he be rich or poor to the physician he must go and he who wants to be governed to him who is able to govern
the ruler who is good for anything ought not to beg his subjects to be ruled by him although the present governors of mankind are of a different stamp they may be justly compared to the mutinous sailors and the true helmsmen to those who are called by them good for nothings and star gazers
precisely so he said
for these reasons and among men like these philosophy the noblest pursuit of all is not likely to be much esteemed by those of the opposite faction not that the greatest and most lasting injury is done to her by her opponents but by her own professing followers the same of whom you suppose the accuser to say that the greater number of them are arrant rogues and the best are useless in which opinion i agreed
yes
and the reason why the good are useless has now been explained
true
then shall we proceed to show that the corruption of the majority is also unavoidable and that this is not to be laid to the charge of philosophy any more than the other
by all means
and let us ask and answer in turn first going back to the description of the gentle and noble nature
truth as you will remember was his leader whom he followed always and in all things failing in this he was an impostor and had no part or lot in true philosophy
yes that was said
well and is not this one quality to mention no others greatly at variance with present notions of him
certainly he said
and have we not a right to say in his defence that the true lover of knowledge is always striving after being that is his nature he will not rest in the multiplicity of individuals which is an appearance only but will go on the keen edge will not be blunted nor the force of his desire abate until he have attained the knowledge of the true nature of every essence by a sympathetic and kindred power in the soul and by that power drawing near and mingling and becoming incorporate with very being having begotten mind and truth he will have knowledge and will live and grow truly and then and not till then will he cease from his travail
nothing he said can be more just than such a description of him
and will the love of a lie be any part of a philosopher s nature
will he not utterly hate a lie
he will
and when truth is the captain we cannot suspect any evil of the band which he leads
impossible
justice and health of mind will be of the company and temperance will follow after
true he replied
neither is there any reason why i should again set in array the philosopher s virtues as you will doubtless remember that courage magnificence apprehension memory were his natural gifts
and you objected that although no one could deny what i then said still if you leave words and look at facts the persons who are thus described are some of them manifestly useless and the greater number utterly depraved we were then led to enquire into the grounds of these accusations and have now arrived at the point of asking why are the majority bad which question of necessity brought us back to the examination and definition of the true philosopher
exactly
and we have next to consider the corruptions of the philosophic nature why so many are spoiled and so few escape spoiling i am speaking of those who were said to be useless but not wicked and when we have done with them we will speak of the imitators of philosophy what manner of men are they who aspire after a profession which is above them and of which they are unworthy and then by their manifold inconsistencies bring upon philosophy and upon all philosophers that universal reprobation of which we speak
what are these corruptions
he said
i will see if i can explain them to you
every one will admit that a nature having in perfection all the qualities which we required in a philosopher is a rare plant which is seldom seen among men
rare indeed
and what numberless and powerful causes tend to destroy these rare natures
what causes
in the first place there are their own virtues their courage temperance and the rest of them every one of which praiseworthy qualities destroys and distracts from philosophy the soul which is the possessor of them
that is very singular he replied
then there are all the ordinary goods of life beauty wealth strength rank and great connections in the state you understand the sort of things these also have a corrupting and distracting effect
i understand but i should like to know more precisely what you mean about them
grasp the truth as a whole i said and in the right way you will then have no difficulty in apprehending the preceding remarks and they will no longer appear strange to you
and how am i to do so
he asked
why i said we know that all germs or seeds whether vegetable or animal when they fail to meet with proper nutriment or climate or soil in proportion to their vigour are all the more sensitive to the want of a suitable environment for evil is a greater enemy to what is good than to what is not
very true
there is reason in supposing that the finest natures when under alien conditions receive more injury than the inferior because the contrast is greater
certainly
and may we not say adeimantus that the most gifted minds when they are ill educated become pre eminently bad
do not great crimes and the spirit of pure evil spring out of a fulness of nature ruined by education rather than from any inferiority whereas weak natures are scarcely capable of any very great good or very great evil
there i think that you are right
and our philosopher follows the same analogy he is like a plant which having proper nurture must necessarily grow and mature into all virtue but if sown and planted in an alien soil becomes the most noxious of all weeds unless he be preserved by some divine power
do you really think as people so often say that our youth are corrupted by sophists or that private teachers of the art corrupt them in any degree worth speaking of
are not the public who say these things the greatest of all sophists
and do they not educate to perfection young and old men and women alike and fashion them after their own hearts
when is this accomplished
he said
when they meet together and the world sits down at an assembly or in a court of law or a theatre or a camp or in any other popular resort and there is a great uproar and they praise some things which are being said or done and blame other things equally exaggerating both shouting and clapping their hands and the echo of the rocks and the place in which they are assembled redoubles the sound of the praise or blame at such a time will not a young man s heart as they say leap within him
will any private training enable him to stand firm against the overwhelming flood of popular opinion
or will he be carried away by the stream
will he not have the notions of good and evil which the public in general have he will do as they do and as they are such will he be
yes socrates necessity will compel him
and yet i said there is a still greater necessity which has not been mentioned
what is that
the gentle force of attainder or confiscation or death which as you are aware these new sophists and educators who are the public apply when their words are powerless
indeed they do and in right good earnest
now what opinion of any other sophist or of any private person can be expected to overcome in such an unequal contest
none he replied
no indeed i said even to make the attempt is a great piece of folly there neither is nor has been nor is ever likely to be any different type of character which has had no other training in virtue but that which is supplied by public opinion i speak my friend of human virtue only what is more than human as the proverb says is not included for i would not have you ignorant that in the present evil state of governments whatever is saved and comes to good is saved by the power of god as we may truly say
i quite assent he replied
then let me crave your assent also to a further observation
what are you going to say
why that all those mercenary individuals whom the many call sophists and whom they deem to be their adversaries do in fact teach nothing but the opinion of the many that is to say the opinions of their assemblies and this is their wisdom
i might compare them to a man who should study the tempers and desires of a mighty strong beast who is fed by him he would learn how to approach and handle him also at what times and from what causes he is dangerous or the reverse and what is the meaning of his several cries and by what sounds when another utters them he is soothed or infuriated and you may suppose further that when by continually attending upon him he has become perfect in all this he calls his knowledge wisdom and makes of it a system or art which he proceeds to teach although he has no real notion of what he means by the principles or passions of which he is speaking but calls this honourable and that dishonourable or good or evil or just or unjust all in accordance with the tastes and tempers of the great brute
good he pronounces to be that in which the beast delights and evil to be that which he dislikes and he can give no other account of them except that the just and noble are the necessary having never himself seen and having no power of explaining to others the nature of either or the difference between them which is immense
by heaven would not such an one be a rare educator
indeed he would
and in what way does he who thinks that wisdom is the discernment of the tempers and tastes of the motley multitude whether in painting or music or finally in politics differ from him whom i have been describing
for when a man consorts with the many and exhibits to them his poem or other work of art or the service which he has done the state making them his judges when he is not obliged the so called necessity of diomede will oblige him to produce whatever they praise
and yet the reasons are utterly ludicrous which they give in confirmation of their own notions about the honourable and good
did you ever hear any of them which were not
no nor am i likely to hear
you recognise the truth of what i have been saying
then let me ask you to consider further whether the world will ever be induced to believe in the existence of absolute beauty rather than of the many beautiful or of the absolute in each kind rather than of the many in each kind
certainly not
then the world cannot possibly be a philosopher
impossible
and therefore philosophers must inevitably fall under the censure of the world
they must
and of individuals who consort with the mob and seek to please them
that is evident
then do you see any way in which the philosopher can be preserved in his calling to the end
and remember what we were saying of him that he was to have quickness and memory and courage and magnificence these were admitted by us to be the true philosopher s gifts
yes
will not such an one from his early childhood be in all things first among all especially if his bodily endowments are like his mental ones
certainly he said
and his friends and fellow citizens will want to use him as he gets older for their own purposes
no question
falling at his feet they will make requests to him and do him honour and flatter him because they want to get into their hands now the power which he will one day possess
that often happens he said
and what will a man such as he is be likely to do under such circumstances especially if he be a citizen of a great city rich and noble and a tall proper youth
will he not be full of boundless aspirations and fancy himself able to manage the affairs of hellenes and of barbarians and having got such notions into his head will he not dilate and elevate himself in the fulness of vain pomp and senseless pride
to be sure he will
now when he is in this state of mind if some one gently comes to him and tells him that he is a fool and must get understanding which can only be got by slaving for it do you think that under such adverse circumstances he will be easily induced to listen
far otherwise
and even if there be some one who through inherent goodness or natural reasonableness has had his eyes opened a little and is humbled and taken captive by philosophy how will his friends behave when they think that they are likely to lose the advantage which they were hoping to reap from his companionship
will they not do and say anything to prevent him from yielding to his better nature and to render his teacher powerless using to this end private intrigues as well as public prosecutions
there can be no doubt of it
and how can one who is thus circumstanced ever become a philosopher
impossible
then were we not right in saying that even the very qualities which make a man a philosopher may if he be ill educated divert him from philosophy no less than riches and their accompaniments and the other so called goods of life
we were quite right
thus my excellent friend is brought about all that ruin and failure which i have been describing of the natures best adapted to the best of all pursuits they are natures which we maintain to be rare at any time this being the class out of which come the men who are the authors of the greatest evil to states and individuals and also of the greatest good when the tide carries them in that direction but a small man never was the doer of any great thing either to individuals or to states
that is most true he said
and so philosophy is left desolate with her marriage rite incomplete for her own have fallen away and forsaken her and while they are leading a false and unbecoming life other unworthy persons seeing that she has no kinsmen to be her protectors enter in and dishonour her and fasten upon her the reproaches which as you say her reprovers utter who affirm of her votaries that some are good for nothing and that the greater number deserve the severest punishment
that is certainly what people say
yes and what else would you expect i said when you think of the puny creatures who seeing this land open to them a land well stocked with fair names and showy titles like prisoners running out of prison into a sanctuary take a leap out of their trades into philosophy those who do so being probably the cleverest hands at their own miserable crafts
for although philosophy be in this evil case still there remains a dignity about her which is not to be found in the arts
and many are thus attracted by her whose natures are imperfect and whose souls are maimed and disfigured by their meannesses as their bodies are by their trades and crafts
is not this unavoidable
yes
are they not exactly like a bald little tinker who has just got out of durance and come into a fortune he takes a bath and puts on a new coat and is decked out as a bridegroom going to marry his master s daughter who is left poor and desolate
a most exact parallel
what will be the issue of such marriages
will they not be vile and bastard
there can be no question of it
and when persons who are unworthy of education approach philosophy and make an alliance with her who is in a rank above them what sort of ideas and opinions are likely to be generated
will they not be sophisms captivating to the ear having nothing in them genuine or worthy of or akin to true wisdom
no doubt he said
then adeimantus i said the worthy disciples of philosophy will be but a small remnant perchance some noble and well educated person detained by exile in her service who in the absence of corrupting influences remains devoted to her or some lofty soul born in a mean city the politics of which he contemns and neglects and there may be a gifted few who leave the arts which they justly despise and come to her or peradventure there are some who are restrained by our friend theages bridle for everything in the life of theages conspired to divert him from philosophy but ill health kept him away from politics
my own case of the internal sign is hardly worth mentioning for rarely if ever has such a monitor been given to any other man
those who belong to this small class have tasted how sweet and blessed a possession philosophy is and have also seen enough of the madness of the multitude and they know that no politician is honest nor is there any champion of justice at whose side they may fight and be saved
such an one may be compared to a man who has fallen among wild beasts he will not join in the wickedness of his fellows but neither is he able singly to resist all their fierce natures and therefore seeing that he would be of no use to the state or to his friends and reflecting that he would have to throw away his life without doing any good either to himself or others he holds his peace and goes his own way
he is like one who in the storm of dust and sleet which the driving wind hurries along retires under the shelter of a wall and seeing the rest of mankind full of wickedness he is content if only he can live his own life and be pure from evil or unrighteousness and depart in peace and good will with bright hopes
yes he said and he will have done a great work before he departs
a great work yes but not the greatest unless he find a state suitable to him for in a state which is suitable to him he will have a larger growth and be the saviour of his country as well as of himself
the causes why philosophy is in such an evil name have now been sufficiently explained the injustice of the charges against her has been shown is there anything more which you wish to say
nothing more on that subject he replied but i should like to know which of the governments now existing is in your opinion the one adapted to her
not any of them i said and that is precisely the accusation which i bring against them not one of them is worthy of the philosophic nature and hence that nature is warped and estranged as the exotic seed which is sown in a foreign land becomes denaturalized and is wont to be overpowered and to lose itself in the new soil even so this growth of philosophy instead of persisting degenerates and receives another character
but if philosophy ever finds in the state that perfection which she herself is then will be seen that she is in truth divine and that all other things whether natures of men or institutions are but human and now i know that you are going to ask what that state is no he said there you are wrong for i was going to ask another question whether it is the state of which we are the founders and inventors or some other
yes i replied ours in most respects but you may remember my saying before that some living authority would always be required in the state having the same idea of the constitution which guided you when as legislator you were laying down the laws
that was said he replied
yes but not in a satisfactory manner you frightened us by interposing objections which certainly showed that the discussion would be long and difficult and what still remains is the reverse of easy
what is there remaining
the question how the study of philosophy may be so ordered as not to be the ruin of the state all great attempts are attended with risk hard is the good as men say
still he said let the point be cleared up and the enquiry will then be complete
i shall not be hindered i said by any want of will but if at all by a want of power my zeal you may see for yourselves and please to remark in what i am about to say how boldly and unhesitatingly i declare that states should pursue philosophy not as they do now but in a different spirit
in what manner
at present i said the students of philosophy are quite young beginning when they are hardly past childhood they devote only the time saved from moneymaking and housekeeping to such pursuits and even those of them who are reputed to have most of the philosophic spirit when they come within sight of the great difficulty of the subject i mean dialectic take themselves off
in after life when invited by some one else they may perhaps go and hear a lecture and about this they make much ado for philosophy is not considered by them to be their proper business at last when they grow old in most cases they are extinguished more truly than heracleitus sun inasmuch as they never light up again
but what ought to be their course
just the opposite
in childhood and youth their study and what philosophy they learn should be suited to their tender years during this period while they are growing up towards manhood the chief and special care should be given to their bodies that they may have them to use in the service of philosophy as life advances and the intellect begins to mature let them increase the gymnastics of the soul but when the strength of our citizens fails and is past civil and military duties then let them range at will and engage in no serious labour as we intend them to live happily here and to crown this life with a similar happiness in another
how truly in earnest you are socrates
he said i am sure of that and yet most of your hearers if i am not mistaken are likely to be still more earnest in their opposition to you and will never be convinced thrasymachus least of all
do not make a quarrel i said between thrasymachus and me who have recently become friends although indeed we were never enemies for i shall go on striving to the utmost until i either convert him and other men or do something which may profit them against the day when they live again and hold the like discourse in another state of existence
you are speaking of a time which is not very near
rather i replied of a time which is as nothing in comparison with eternity
nevertheless i do not wonder that the many refuse to believe for they have never seen that of which we are now speaking realized they have seen only a conventional imitation of philosophy consisting of words artificially brought together not like these of ours having a natural unity
but a human being who in word and work is perfectly moulded as far as he can be into the proportion and likeness of virtue such a man ruling in a city which bears the same image they have never yet seen neither one nor many of them do you think that they ever did
no indeed
no my friend and they have seldom if ever heard free and noble sentiments such as men utter when they are earnestly and by every means in their power seeking after truth for the sake of knowledge while they look coldly on the subtleties of controversy of which the end is opinion and strife whether they meet with them in the courts of law or in society
they are strangers he said to the words of which you speak
and this was what we foresaw and this was the reason why truth forced us to admit not without fear and hesitation that neither cities nor states nor individuals will ever attain perfection until the small class of philosophers whom we termed useless but not corrupt are providentially compelled whether they will or not to take care of the state and until a like necessity be laid on the state to obey them or until kings or if not kings the sons of kings or princes are divinely inspired with a true love of true philosophy
that either or both of these alternatives are impossible i see no reason to affirm if they were so we might indeed be justly ridiculed as dreamers and visionaries
am i not right
quite right
if then in the countless ages of the past or at the present hour in some foreign clime which is far away and beyond our ken the perfected philosopher is or has been or hereafter shall be compelled by a superior power to have the charge of the state we are ready to assert to the death that this our constitution has been and is yea and will be whenever the muse of philosophy is queen
there is no impossibility in all this that there is a difficulty we acknowledge ourselves
my opinion agrees with yours he said
but do you mean to say that this is not the opinion of the multitude
i should imagine not he replied
o my friend i said do not attack the multitude they will change their minds if not in an aggressive spirit but gently and with the view of soothing them and removing their dislike of over education you show them your philosophers as they really are and describe as you were just now doing their character and profession and then mankind will see that he of whom you are speaking is not such as they supposed if they view him in this new light they will surely change their notion of him and answer in another strain
who can be at enmity with one who loves them who that is himself gentle and free from envy will be jealous of one in whom there is no jealousy
nay let me answer for you that in a few this harsh temper may be found but not in the majority of mankind
i quite agree with you he said
and do you not also think as i do that the harsh feeling which the many entertain towards philosophy originates in the pretenders who rush in uninvited and are always abusing them and finding fault with them who make persons instead of things the theme of their conversation
and nothing can be more unbecoming in philosophers than this
it is most unbecoming
for he adeimantus whose mind is fixed upon true being has surely no time to look down upon the affairs of earth or to be filled with malice and envy contending against men his eye is ever directed towards things fixed and immutable which he sees neither injuring nor injured by one another but all in order moving according to reason these he imitates and to these he will as far as he can conform himself
can a man help imitating that with which he holds reverential converse
impossible
and the philosopher holding converse with the divine order becomes orderly and divine as far as the nature of man allows but like every one else he will suffer from detraction
of course
and if a necessity be laid upon him of fashioning not only himself but human nature generally whether in states or individuals into that which he beholds elsewhere will he think you be an unskilful artificer of justice temperance and every civil virtue
anything but unskilful
and if the world perceives that what we are saying about him is the truth will they be angry with philosophy
will they disbelieve us when we tell them that no state can be happy which is not designed by artists who imitate the heavenly pattern
they will not be angry if they understand he said
but how will they draw out the plan of which you are speaking
they will begin by taking the state and the manners of men from which as from a tablet they will rub out the picture and leave a clean surface
this is no easy task
but whether easy or not herein will lie the difference between them and every other legislator they will have nothing to do either with individual or state and will inscribe no laws until they have either found or themselves made a clean surface
they will be very right he said
having effected this they will proceed to trace an outline of the constitution
no doubt
and when they are filling in the work as i conceive they will often turn their eyes upwards and downwards i mean that they will first look at absolute justice and beauty and temperance and again at the human copy and will mingle and temper the various elements of life into the image of a man and this they will conceive according to that other image which when existing among men homer calls the form and likeness of god
very true he said
and one feature they will erase and another they will put in until they have made the ways of men as far as possible agreeable to the ways of god
indeed he said in no way could they make a fairer picture
and now i said are we beginning to persuade those whom you described as rushing at us with might and main that the painter of constitutions is such an one as we are praising at whom they were so very indignant because to his hands we committed the state and are they growing a little calmer at what they have just heard
much calmer if there is any sense in them
why where can they still find any ground for objection
will they doubt that the philosopher is a lover of truth and being
they would not be so unreasonable
or that his nature being such as we have delineated is akin to the highest good
neither can they doubt this
but again will they tell us that such a nature placed under favourable circumstances will not be perfectly good and wise if any ever was
or will they prefer those whom we have rejected
surely not
then will they still be angry at our saying that until philosophers bear rule states and individuals will have no rest from evil nor will this our imaginary state ever be realized
i think that they will be less angry
shall we assume that they are not only less angry but quite gentle and that they have been converted and for very shame if for no other reason cannot refuse to come to terms
by all means he said
then let us suppose that the reconciliation has been effected
will any one deny the other point that there may be sons of kings or princes who are by nature philosophers
surely no man he said
and when they have come into being will any one say that they must of necessity be destroyed that they can hardly be saved is not denied even by us but that in the whole course of ages no single one of them can escape who will venture to affirm this
who indeed
but said i one is enough let there be one man who has a city obedient to his will and he might bring into existence the ideal polity about which the world is so incredulous
yes one is enough
the ruler may impose the laws and institutions which we have been describing and the citizens may possibly be willing to obey them
certainly
and that others should approve of what we approve is no miracle or impossibility
i think not
but we have sufficiently shown in what has preceded that all this if only possible is assuredly for the best
we have
and now we say not only that our laws if they could be enacted would be for the best but also that the enactment of them though difficult is not impossible
very good
and so with pain and toil we have reached the end of one subject but more remains to be discussed how and by what studies and pursuits will the saviours of the constitution be created and at what ages are they to apply themselves to their several studies
certainly
i omitted the troublesome business of the possession of women and the procreation of children and the appointment of the rulers because i knew that the perfect state would be eyed with jealousy and was difficult of attainment but that piece of cleverness was not of much service to me for i had to discuss them all the same
the women and children are now disposed of but the other question of the rulers must be investigated from the very beginning
we were saying as you will remember that they were to be lovers of their country tried by the test of pleasures and pains and neither in hardships nor in dangers nor at any other critical moment were to lose their patriotism he was to be rejected who failed but he who always came forth pure like gold tried in the refiner s fire was to be made a ruler and to receive honours and rewards in life and after death
this was the sort of thing which was being said and then the argument turned aside and veiled her face not liking to stir the question which has now arisen
i perfectly remember he said
yes my friend i said and i then shrank from hazarding the bold word but now let me dare to say that the perfect guardian must be a philosopher
yes he said let that be affirmed
and do not suppose that there will be many of them for the gifts which were deemed by us to be essential rarely grow together they are mostly found in shreds and patches
what do you mean
he said
you are aware i replied that quick intelligence memory sagacity cleverness and similar qualities do not often grow together and that persons who possess them and are at the same time high spirited and magnanimous are not so constituted by nature as to live orderly and in a peaceful and settled manner they are driven any way by their impulses and all solid principle goes out of them
very true he said
on the other hand those steadfast natures which can better be depended upon which in a battle are impregnable to fear and immovable are equally immovable when there is anything to be learned they are always in a torpid state and are apt to yawn and go to sleep over any intellectual toil
quite true
and yet we were saying that both qualities were necessary in those to whom the higher education is to be imparted and who are to share in any office or command
certainly he said
and will they be a class which is rarely found
yes indeed
then the aspirant must not only be tested in those labours and dangers and pleasures which we mentioned before but there is another kind of probation which we did not mention he must be exercised also in many kinds of knowledge to see whether the soul will be able to endure the highest of all or will faint under them as in any other studies and exercises
yes he said you are quite right in testing him
but what do you mean by the highest of all knowledge
you may remember i said that we divided the soul into three parts and distinguished the several natures of justice temperance courage and wisdom
indeed he said if i had forgotten i should not deserve to hear more
and do you remember the word of caution which preceded the discussion of them
to what do you refer
we were saying if i am not mistaken that he who wanted to see them in their perfect beauty must take a longer and more circuitous way at the end of which they would appear but that we could add on a popular exposition of them on a level with the discussion which had preceded
and you replied that such an exposition would be enough for you and so the enquiry was continued in what to me seemed to be a very inaccurate manner whether you were satisfied or not it is for you to say
yes he said i thought and the others thought that you gave us a fair measure of truth
but my friend i said a measure of such things which in any degree falls short of the whole truth is not fair measure for nothing imperfect is the measure of anything although persons are too apt to be contented and think that they need search no further
not an uncommon case when people are indolent
yes i said and there cannot be any worse fault in a guardian of the state and of the laws
true
the guardian then i said must be required to take the longer circuit and toil at learning as well as at gymnastics or he will never reach the highest knowledge of all which as we were just now saying is his proper calling
what he said is there a knowledge still higher than this higher than justice and the other virtues
yes i said there is
and of the virtues too we must behold not the outline merely as at present nothing short of the most finished picture should satisfy us
when little things are elaborated with an infinity of pains in order that they may appear in their full beauty and utmost clearness how ridiculous that we should not think the highest truths worthy of attaining the highest accuracy
a right noble thought but do you suppose that we shall refrain from asking you what is this highest knowledge
nay i said ask if you will but i am certain that you have heard the answer many times and now you either do not understand me or as i rather think you are disposed to be troublesome for you have often been told that the idea of good is the highest knowledge and that all other things become useful and advantageous only by their use of this
you can hardly be ignorant that of this i was about to speak concerning which as you have often heard me say we know so little and without which any other knowledge or possession of any kind will profit us nothing
do you think that the possession of all other things is of any value if we do not possess the good
or the knowledge of all other things if we have no knowledge of beauty and goodness
assuredly not
you are further aware that most people affirm pleasure to be the good but the finer sort of wits say it is knowledge
yes
and you are aware too that the latter cannot explain what they mean by knowledge but are obliged after all to say knowledge of the good
how ridiculous
yes i said that they should begin by reproaching us with our ignorance of the good and then presume our knowledge of it for the good they define to be knowledge of the good just as if we understood them when they use the term good this is of course ridiculous
most true he said
and those who make pleasure their good are in equal perplexity for they are compelled to admit that there are bad pleasures as well as good
certainly
and therefore to acknowledge that bad and good are the same
true
there can be no doubt about the numerous difficulties in which this question is involved
there can be none
further do we not see that many are willing to do or to have or to seem to be what is just and honourable without the reality but no one is satisfied with the appearance of good the reality is what they seek in the case of the good appearance is despised by every one
very true he said
of this then which every soul of man pursues and makes the end of all his actions having a presentiment that there is such an end and yet hesitating because neither knowing the nature nor having the same assurance of this as of other things and therefore losing whatever good there is in other things of a principle such and so great as this ought the best men in our state to whom everything is entrusted to be in the darkness of ignorance
certainly not he said
i am sure i said that he who does not know how the beautiful and the just are likewise good will be but a sorry guardian of them and i suspect that no one who is ignorant of the good will have a true knowledge of them
that he said is a shrewd suspicion of yours
and if we only have a guardian who has this knowledge our state will be perfectly ordered
of course he replied but i wish that you would tell me whether you conceive this supreme principle of the good to be knowledge or pleasure or different from either
aye i said i knew all along that a fastidious gentleman like you would not be contented with the thoughts of other people about these matters
true socrates but i must say that one who like you has passed a lifetime in the study of philosophy should not be always repeating the opinions of others and never telling his own
well but has any one a right to say positively what he does not know
not he said with the assurance of positive certainty he has no right to do that but he may say what he thinks as a matter of opinion
and do you not know i said that all mere opinions are bad and the best of them blind
you would not deny that those who have any true notion without intelligence are only like blind men who feel their way along the road
very true
and do you wish to behold what is blind and crooked and base when others will tell you of brightness and beauty
still i must implore you socrates said glaucon not to turn away just as you are reaching the goal if you will only give such an explanation of the good as you have already given of justice and temperance and the other virtues we shall be satisfied
yes my friend and i shall be at least equally satisfied but i cannot help fearing that i shall fail and that my indiscreet zeal will bring ridicule upon me
no sweet sirs let us not at present ask what is the actual nature of the good for to reach what is now in my thoughts would be an effort too great for me
but of the child of the good who is likest him i would fain speak if i could be sure that you wished to hear otherwise not
by all means he said tell us about the child and you shall remain in our debt for the account of the parent
i do indeed wish i replied that i could pay and you receive the account of the parent and not as now of the offspring only take however this latter by way of interest and at the same time have a care that i do not render a false account although i have no intention of deceiving you
yes we will take all the care that we can proceed
yes i said but i must first come to an understanding with you and remind you of what i have mentioned in the course of this discussion and at many other times
what
the old story that there is a many beautiful and a many good and so of other things which we describe and define to all of them the term many is applied
true he said
and there is an absolute beauty and an absolute good and of other things to which the term many is applied there is an absolute for they may be brought under a single idea which is called the essence of each
very true
the many as we say are seen but not known and the ideas are known but not seen
exactly
and what is the organ with which we see the visible things
the sight he said
and with the hearing i said we hear and with the other senses perceive the other objects of sense
true
but have you remarked that sight is by far the most costly and complex piece of workmanship which the artificer of the senses ever contrived
no i never have he said
then reflect has the ear or voice need of any third or additional nature in order that the one may be able to hear and the other to be heard
nothing of the sort
no indeed i replied and the same is true of most if not all the other senses you would not say that any of them requires such an addition
certainly not
but you see that without the addition of some other nature there is no seeing or being seen
how do you mean
sight being as i conceive in the eyes and he who has eyes wanting to see colour being also present in them still unless there be a third nature specially adapted to the purpose the owner of the eyes will see nothing and the colours will be invisible
of what nature are you speaking
of that which you term light i replied
true he said
noble then is the bond which links together sight and visibility and great beyond other bonds by no small difference of nature for light is their bond and light is no ignoble thing
nay he said the reverse of ignoble
and which i said of the gods in heaven would you say was the lord of this element
whose is that light which makes the eye to see perfectly and the visible to appear
you mean the sun as you and all mankind say
may not the relation of sight to this deity be described as follows
how
neither sight nor the eye in which sight resides is the sun
no
yet of all the organs of sense the eye is the most like the sun
by far the most like
and the power which the eye possesses is a sort of effluence which is dispensed from the sun
exactly
then the sun is not sight but the author of sight who is recognised by sight
true he said
and this is he whom i call the child of the good whom the good begat in his own likeness to be in the visible world in relation to sight and the things of sight what the good is in the intellectual world in relation to mind and the things of mind will you be a little more explicit
he said
why you know i said that the eyes when a person directs them towards objects on which the light of day is no longer shining but the moon and stars only see dimly and are nearly blind they seem to have no clearness of vision in them
very true
but when they are directed towards objects on which the sun shines they see clearly and there is sight in them
certainly
and the soul is like the eye when resting upon that on which truth and being shine the soul perceives and understands and is radiant with intelligence but when turned towards the twilight of becoming and perishing then she has opinion only and goes blinking about and is first of one opinion and then of another and seems to have no intelligence
just so
now that which imparts truth to the known and the power of knowing to the knower is what i would have you term the idea of good and this you will deem to be the cause of science and of truth in so far as the latter becomes the subject of knowledge beautiful too as are both truth and knowledge you will be right in esteeming this other nature as more beautiful than either and as in the previous instance light and sight may be truly said to be like the sun and yet not to be the sun so in this other sphere science and truth may be deemed to be like the good but not the good the good has a place of honour yet higher
what a wonder of beauty that must be he said which is the author of science and truth and yet surpasses them in beauty for you surely cannot mean to say that pleasure is the good
god forbid i replied but may i ask you to consider the image in another point of view
in what point of view
you would say would you not that the sun is not only the author of visibility in all visible things but of generation and nourishment and growth though he himself is not generation
certainly
in like manner the good may be said to be not only the author of knowledge to all things known but of their being and essence and yet the good is not essence but far exceeds essence in dignity and power
glaucon said with a ludicrous earnestness by the light of heaven how amazing
yes i said and the exaggeration may be set down to you for you made me utter my fancies
and pray continue to utter them at any rate let us hear if there is anything more to be said about the similitude of the sun
yes i said there is a great deal more
then omit nothing however slight
i will do my best i said but i should think that a great deal will have to be omitted
i hope not he said
you have to imagine then that there are two ruling powers and that one of them is set over the intellectual world the other over the visible
i do not say heaven lest you should fancy that i am playing upon the name 
may i suppose that you have this distinction of the visible and intelligible fixed in your mind
i have
now take a line which has been cut into two unequal parts and divide each of them again in the same proportion and suppose the two main divisions to answer one to the visible and the other to the intelligible and then compare the subdivisions in respect of their clearness and want of clearness and you will find that the first section in the sphere of the visible consists of images
and by images i mean in the first place shadows and in the second place reflections in water and in solid smooth and polished bodies and the like do you understand
yes i understand
imagine now the other section of which this is only the resemblance to include the animals which we see and everything that grows or is made
very good
would you not admit that both the sections of this division have different degrees of truth and that the copy is to the original as the sphere of opinion is to the sphere of knowledge
most undoubtedly
next proceed to consider the manner in which the sphere of the intellectual is to be divided
in what manner
thus there are two subdivisions in the lower of which the soul uses the figures given by the former division as images the enquiry can only be hypothetical and instead of going upwards to a principle descends to the other end in the higher of the two the soul passes out of hypotheses and goes up to a principle which is above hypotheses making no use of images as in the former case but proceeding only in and through the ideas themselves
i do not quite understand your meaning he said
then i will try again you will understand me better when i have made some preliminary remarks
you are aware that students of geometry arithmetic and the kindred sciences assume the odd and the even and the figures and three kinds of angles and the like in their several branches of science these are their hypotheses which they and every body are supposed to know and therefore they do not deign to give any account of them either to themselves or others but they begin with them and go on until they arrive at last and in a consistent manner at their conclusion
yes he said i know
and do you not know also that although they make use of the visible forms and reason about them they are thinking not of these but of the ideals which they resemble not of the figures which they draw but of the absolute square and the absolute diameter and so on the forms which they draw or make and which have shadows and reflections in water of their own are converted by them into images but they are really seeking to behold the things themselves which can only be seen with the eye of the mind
that is true
and of this kind i spoke as the intelligible although in the search after it the soul is compelled to use hypotheses not ascending to a first principle because she is unable to rise above the region of hypothesis but employing the objects of which the shadows below are resemblances in their turn as images they having in relation to the shadows and reflections of them a greater distinctness and therefore a higher value
i understand he said that you are speaking of the province of geometry and the sister arts
and when i speak of the other division of the intelligible you will understand me to speak of that other sort of knowledge which reason herself attains by the power of dialectic using the hypotheses not as first principles but only as hypotheses that is to say as steps and points of departure into a world which is above hypotheses in order that she may soar beyond them to the first principle of the whole and clinging to this and then to that which depends on this by successive steps she descends again without the aid of any sensible object from ideas through ideas and in ideas she ends
i understand you he replied not perfectly for you seem to me to be describing a task which is really tremendous but at any rate i understand you to say that knowledge and being which the science of dialectic contemplates are clearer than the notions of the arts as they are termed which proceed from hypotheses only these are also contemplated by the understanding and not by the senses yet because they start from hypotheses and do not ascend to a principle those who contemplate them appear to you not to exercise the higher reason upon them although when a first principle is added to them they are cognizable by the higher reason
and the habit which is concerned with geometry and the cognate sciences i suppose that you would term understanding and not reason as being intermediate between opinion and reason
you have quite conceived my meaning i said and now corresponding to these four divisions let there be four faculties in the soul reason answering to the highest understanding to the second faith to the third and perception of shadows to the last and let there be a scale of them and let us suppose that the several faculties have clearness in the same degree that their objects have truth
i understand he replied and give my assent and accept your arrangement
book vii
and now i said let me show in a figure how far our nature is enlightened or unenlightened behold
human beings living in a underground den which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den here they have been from their childhood and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move and can only see before them being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads
above and behind them a fire is blazing at a distance and between the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way and you will see if you look a low wall built along the way like the screen which marionette players have in front of them over which they show the puppets
i see
and do you see i said men passing along the wall carrying all sorts of vessels and statues and figures of animals made of wood and stone and various materials which appear over the wall
some of them are talking others silent
you have shown me a strange image and they are strange prisoners
like ourselves i replied and they see only their own shadows or the shadows of one another which the fire throws on the opposite wall of the cave
true he said how could they see anything but the shadows if they were never allowed to move their heads
and of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would only see the shadows
yes he said
and if they were able to converse with one another would they not suppose that they were naming what was actually before them
very true
and suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from the other side would they not be sure to fancy when one of the passers by spoke that the voice which they heard came from the passing shadow
no question he replied
to them i said the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows of the images
that is certain
and now look again and see what will naturally follow if the prisoners are released and disabused of their error
at first when any of them is liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his neck round and walk and look towards the light he will suffer sharp pains the glare will distress him and he will be unable to see the realities of which in his former state he had seen the shadows and then conceive some one saying to him that what he saw before was an illusion but that now when he is approaching nearer to being and his eye is turned towards more real existence he has a clearer vision what will be his reply
and you may further imagine that his instructor is pointing to the objects as they pass and requiring him to name them will he not be perplexed
will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the objects which are now shown to him
far truer
and if he is compelled to look straight at the light will he not have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take refuge in the objects of vision which he can see and which he will conceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him
true he said
and suppose once more that he is reluctantly dragged up a steep and rugged ascent and held fast until he is forced into the presence of the sun himself is he not likely to be pained and irritated
when he approaches the light his eyes will be dazzled and he will not be able to see anything at all of what are now called realities
not all in a moment he said
he will require to grow accustomed to the sight of the upper world
and first he will see the shadows best next the reflections of men and other objects in the water and then the objects themselves then he will gaze upon the light of the moon and the stars and the spangled heaven and he will see the sky and the stars by night better than the sun or the light of the sun by day
certainly
last of all he will be able to see the sun and not mere reflections of him in the water but he will see him in his own proper place and not in another and he will contemplate him as he is
certainly
he will then proceed to argue that this is he who gives the season and the years and is the guardian of all that is in the visible world and in a certain way the cause of all things which he and his fellows have been accustomed to behold
clearly he said he would first see the sun and then reason about him
and when he remembered his old habitation and the wisdom of the den and his fellow prisoners do you not suppose that he would felicitate himself on the change and pity them
certainly he would
and if they were in the habit of conferring honours among themselves on those who were quickest to observe the passing shadows and to remark which of them went before and which followed after and which were together and who were therefore best able to draw conclusions as to the future do you think that he would care for such honours and glories or envy the possessors of them
would he not say with homer better to be the poor servant of a poor master and to endure anything rather than think as they do and live after their manner
yes he said i think that he would rather suffer anything than entertain these false notions and live in this miserable manner
imagine once more i said such an one coming suddenly out of the sun to be replaced in his old situation would he not be certain to have his eyes full of darkness
to be sure he said
and if there were a contest and he had to compete in measuring the shadows with the prisoners who had never moved out of the den while his sight was still weak and before his eyes had become steady would he not be ridiculous
men would say of him that up he went and down he came without his eyes and that it was better not even to think of ascending and if any one tried to loose another and lead him up to the light let them only catch the offender and they would put him to death
no question he said
this entire allegory i said you may now append dear glaucon to the previous argument the prison house is the world of sight the light of the fire is the sun and you will not misapprehend me if you interpret the journey upwards to be the ascent of the soul into the intellectual world according to my poor belief which at your desire i have expressed whether rightly or wrongly god knows
but whether true or false my opinion is that in the world of knowledge the idea of good appears last of all and is seen only with an effort and when seen is also inferred to be the universal author of all things beautiful and right parent of light and of the lord of light in this visible world and the immediate source of reason and truth in the intellectual and that this is the power upon which he who would act rationally either in public or private life must have his eye fixed
i agree he said as far as i am able to understand you
moreover i said you must not wonder that those who attain to this beatific vision are unwilling to descend to human affairs for their souls are ever hastening into the upper world where they desire to dwell which desire of theirs is very natural if our allegory may be trusted
yes very natural
and is there anything surprising in one who passes from divine contemplations to the evil state of man misbehaving himself in a ridiculous manner if while his eyes are blinking and before he has become accustomed to the surrounding darkness he is compelled to fight in courts of law or in other places about the images or the shadows of images of justice and is endeavouring to meet the conceptions of those who have never yet seen absolute justice
anything but surprising he replied
any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of the eyes are of two kinds and arise from two causes either from coming out of the light or from going into the light which is true of the mind s eye quite as much as of the bodily eye and he who remembers this when he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and weak will not be too ready to laugh he will first ask whether that soul of man has come out of the brighter life and is unable to see because unaccustomed to the dark or having turned from darkness to the day is dazzled by excess of light
and he will count the one happy in his condition and state of being and he will pity the other or if he have a mind to laugh at the soul which comes from below into the light there will be more reason in this than in the laugh which greets him who returns from above out of the light into the den
that he said is a very just distinction
but then if i am right certain professors of education must be wrong when they say that they can put a knowledge into the soul which was not there before like sight into blind eyes
they undoubtedly say this he replied
whereas our argument shows that the power and capacity of learning exists in the soul already and that just as the eye was unable to turn from darkness to light without the whole body so too the instrument of knowledge can only by the movement of the whole soul be turned from the world of becoming into that of being and learn by degrees to endure the sight of being and of the brightest and best of being or in other words of the good
very true
and must there not be some art which will effect conversion in the easiest and quickest manner not implanting the faculty of sight for that exists already but has been turned in the wrong direction and is looking away from the truth
yes he said such an art may be presumed
and whereas the other so called virtues of the soul seem to be akin to bodily qualities for even when they are not originally innate they can be implanted later by habit and exercise the virtue of wisdom more than anything else contains a divine element which always remains and by this conversion is rendered useful and profitable or on the other hand hurtful and useless
did you never observe the narrow intelligence flashing from the keen eye of a clever rogue how eager he is how clearly his paltry soul sees the way to his end he is the reverse of blind but his keen eye sight is forced into the service of evil and he is mischievous in proportion to his cleverness
very true he said
but what if there had been a circumcision of such natures in the days of their youth and they had been severed from those sensual pleasures such as eating and drinking which like leaden weights were attached to them at their birth and which drag them down and turn the vision of their souls upon the things that are below if i say they had been released from these impediments and turned in the opposite direction the very same faculty in them would have seen the truth as keenly as they see what their eyes are turned to now
very likely
yes i said and there is another thing which is likely or rather a necessary inference from what has preceded that neither the uneducated and uninformed of the truth nor yet those who never make an end of their education will be able ministers of state not the former because they have no single aim of duty which is the rule of all their actions private as well as public nor the latter because they will not act at all except upon compulsion fancying that they are already dwelling apart in the islands of the blest
very true he replied
then i said the business of us who are the founders of the state will be to compel the best minds to attain that knowledge which we have already shown to be the greatest of all they must continue to ascend until they arrive at the good but when they have ascended and seen enough we must not allow them to do as they do now
what do you mean
i mean that they remain in the upper world but this must not be allowed they must be made to descend again among the prisoners in the den and partake of their labours and honours whether they are worth having or not
but is not this unjust
he said ought we to give them a worse life when they might have a better
you have again forgotten my friend i said the intention of the legislator who did not aim at making any one class in the state happy above the rest the happiness was to be in the whole state and he held the citizens together by persuasion and necessity making them benefactors of the state and therefore benefactors of one another to this end he created them not to please themselves but to be his instruments in binding up the state
true he said i had forgotten
observe glaucon that there will be no injustice in compelling our philosophers to have a care and providence of others we shall explain to them that in other states men of their class are not obliged to share in the toils of politics and this is reasonable for they grow up at their own sweet will and the government would rather not have them
being self taught they cannot be expected to show any gratitude for a culture which they have never received
but we have brought you into the world to be rulers of the hive kings of yourselves and of the other citizens and have educated you far better and more perfectly than they have been educated and you are better able to share in the double duty
wherefore each of you when his turn comes must go down to the general underground abode and get the habit of seeing in the dark
when you have acquired the habit you will see ten thousand times better than the inhabitants of the den and you will know what the several images are and what they represent because you have seen the beautiful and just and good in their truth
and thus our state which is also yours will be a reality and not a dream only and will be administered in a spirit unlike that of other states in which men fight with one another about shadows only and are distracted in the struggle for power which in their eyes is a great good
whereas the truth is that the state in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern is always the best and most quietly governed and the state in which they are most eager the worst
quite true he replied
and will our pupils when they hear this refuse to take their turn at the toils of state when they are allowed to spend the greater part of their time with one another in the heavenly light
impossible he answered for they are just men and the commands which we impose upon them are just there can be no doubt that every one of them will take office as a stern necessity and not after the fashion of our present rulers of state
yes my friend i said and there lies the point
you must contrive for your future rulers another and a better life than that of a ruler and then you may have a well ordered state for only in the state which offers this will they rule who are truly rich not in silver and gold but in virtue and wisdom which are the true blessings of life
whereas if they go to the administration of public affairs poor and hungering after their own private advantage thinking that hence they are to snatch the chief good order there can never be for they will be fighting about office and the civil and domestic broils which thus arise will be the ruin of the rulers themselves and of the whole state
most true he replied
and the only life which looks down upon the life of political ambition is that of true philosophy
do you know of any other
indeed i do not he said
and those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task
for if they are there will be rival lovers and they will fight
no question
who then are those whom we shall compel to be guardians
surely they will be the men who are wisest about affairs of state and by whom the state is best administered and who at the same time have other honours and another and a better life than that of politics
they are the men and i will choose them he replied
and now shall we consider in what way such guardians will be produced and how they are to be brought from darkness to light as some are said to have ascended from the world below to the gods
by all means he replied
the process i said is not the turning over of an oyster shell but the turning round of a soul passing from a day which is little better than night to the true day of being that is the ascent from below which we affirm to be true philosophy
quite so
and should we not enquire what sort of knowledge has the power of effecting such a change
certainly
what sort of knowledge is there which would draw the soul from becoming to being
and another consideration has just occurred to me you will remember that our young men are to be warrior athletes
yes that was said
then this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality
what quality
usefulness in war
yes if possible
there were two parts in our former scheme of education were there not
just so
there was gymnastic which presided over the growth and decay of the body and may therefore be regarded as having to do with generation and corruption
true
then that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover
no
but what do you say of music which also entered to a certain extent into our former scheme
music he said as you will remember was the counterpart of gymnastic and trained the guardians by the influences of habit by harmony making them harmonious by rhythm rhythmical but not giving them science and the words whether fabulous or possibly true had kindred elements of rhythm and harmony in them
but in music there was nothing which tended to that good which you are now seeking
you are most accurate i said in your recollection in music there certainly was nothing of the kind
but what branch of knowledge is there my dear glaucon which is of the desired nature since all the useful arts were reckoned mean by us
undoubtedly and yet if music and gymnastic are excluded and the arts are also excluded what remains
well i said there may be nothing left of our special subjects and then we shall have to take something which is not special but of universal application
what may that be
a something which all arts and sciences and intelligences use in common and which every one first has to learn among the elements of education
what is that
the little matter of distinguishing one two and three in a word number and calculation do not all arts and sciences necessarily partake of them
yes
then the art of war partakes of them
to be sure
then palamedes whenever he appears in tragedy proves agamemnon ridiculously unfit to be a general
did you never remark how he declares that he had invented number and had numbered the ships and set in array the ranks of the army at troy which implies that they had never been numbered before and agamemnon must be supposed literally to have been incapable of counting his own feet how could he if he was ignorant of number
and if that is true what sort of general must he have been
i should say a very strange one if this was as you say
can we deny that a warrior should have a knowledge of arithmetic
certainly he should if he is to have the smallest understanding of military tactics or indeed i should rather say if he is to be a man at all
i should like to know whether you have the same notion which i have of this study
what is your notion
it appears to me to be a study of the kind which we are seeking and which leads naturally to reflection but never to have been rightly used for the true use of it is simply to draw the soul towards being
will you explain your meaning
he said
i will try i said and i wish you would share the enquiry with me and say yes or no when i attempt to distinguish in my own mind what branches of knowledge have this attracting power in order that we may have clearer proof that arithmetic is as i suspect one of them
explain he said
i mean to say that objects of sense are of two kinds some of them do not invite thought because the sense is an adequate judge of them while in the case of other objects sense is so untrustworthy that further enquiry is imperatively demanded
you are clearly referring he said to the manner in which the senses are imposed upon by distance and by painting in light and shade
no i said that is not at all my meaning
then what is your meaning
when speaking of uninviting objects i mean those which do not pass from one sensation to the opposite inviting objects are those which do in this latter case the sense coming upon the object whether at a distance or near gives no more vivid idea of anything in particular than of its opposite
an illustration will make my meaning clearer here are three fingers a little finger a second finger and a middle finger
very good
you may suppose that they are seen quite close and here comes the point
what is it
each of them equally appears a finger whether seen in the middle or at the extremity whether white or black or thick or thin it makes no difference a finger is a finger all the same
in these cases a man is not compelled to ask of thought the question what is a finger
for the sight never intimates to the mind that a finger is other than a finger
true
and therefore i said as we might expect there is nothing here which invites or excites intelligence
there is not he said
but is this equally true of the greatness and smallness of the fingers
can sight adequately perceive them
and is no difference made by the circumstance that one of the fingers is in the middle and another at the extremity
and in like manner does the touch adequately perceive the qualities of thickness or thinness of softness or hardness
and so of the other senses do they give perfect intimations of such matters
is not their mode of operation on this wise the sense which is concerned with the quality of hardness is necessarily concerned also with the quality of softness and only intimates to the soul that the same thing is felt to be both hard and soft
you are quite right he said
and must not the soul be perplexed at this intimation which the sense gives of a hard which is also soft
what again is the meaning of light and heavy if that which is light is also heavy and that which is heavy light
yes he said these intimations which the soul receives are very curious and require to be explained
yes i said and in these perplexities the soul naturally summons to her aid calculation and intelligence that she may see whether the several objects announced to her are one or two
true
and if they turn out to be two is not each of them one and different
certainly
and if each is one and both are two she will conceive the two as in a state of division for if there were undivided they could only be conceived of as one
true
the eye certainly did see both small and great but only in a confused manner they were not distinguished
yes
whereas the thinking mind intending to light up the chaos was compelled to reverse the process and look at small and great as separate and not confused
very true
was not this the beginning of the enquiry what is great
and what is small
exactly so
and thus arose the distinction of the visible and the intelligible
most true
this was what i meant when i spoke of impressions which invited the intellect or the reverse those which are simultaneous with opposite impressions invite thought those which are not simultaneous do not
i understand he said and agree with you
and to which class do unity and number belong
i do not know he replied
think a little and you will see that what has preceded will supply the answer for if simple unity could be adequately perceived by the sight or by any other sense then as we were saying in the case of the finger there would be nothing to attract towards being but when there is some contradiction always present and one is the reverse of one and involves the conception of plurality then thought begins to be aroused within us and the soul perplexed and wanting to arrive at a decision asks what is absolute unity
this is the way in which the study of the one has a power of drawing and converting the mind to the contemplation of true being
and surely he said this occurs notably in the case of one for we see the same thing to be both one and infinite in multitude
yes i said and this being true of one must be equally true of all number
certainly
and all arithmetic and calculation have to do with number
yes
and they appear to lead the mind towards truth
yes in a very remarkable manner
then this is knowledge of the kind for which we are seeking having a double use military and philosophical for the man of war must learn the art of number or he will not know how to array his troops and the philosopher also because he has to rise out of the sea of change and lay hold of true being and therefore he must be an arithmetician
that is true
and our guardian is both warrior and philosopher
certainly
then this is a kind of knowledge which legislation may fitly prescribe and we must endeavour to persuade those who are to be the principal men of our state to go and learn arithmetic not as amateurs but they must carry on the study until they see the nature of numbers with the mind only nor again like merchants or retail traders with a view to buying or selling but for the sake of their military use and of the soul herself and because this will be the easiest way for her to pass from becoming to truth and being
that is excellent he said
yes i said and now having spoken of it i must add how charming the science is
and in how many ways it conduces to our desired end if pursued in the spirit of a philosopher and not of a shopkeeper
how do you mean
i mean as i was saying that arithmetic has a very great and elevating effect compelling the soul to reason about abstract number and rebelling against the introduction of visible or tangible objects into the argument
you know how steadily the masters of the art repel and ridicule any one who attempts to divide absolute unity when he is calculating and if you divide they multiply that they integrate the number because they deny the possibility of fractions or that division is regarded by them as a process of multiplication for the fractions of one continue to be units
taking care that one shall continue one and not become lost in fractions
that is very true
now suppose a person were to say to them o my friends what are these wonderful numbers about which you are reasoning in which as you say there is a unity such as you demand and each unit is equal invariable indivisible what would they answer
they would answer as i should conceive that they were speaking of those numbers which can only be realized in thought
then you see that this knowledge may be truly called necessary necessitating as it clearly does the use of the pure intelligence in the attainment of pure truth
yes that is a marked characteristic of it
and have you further observed that those who have a natural talent for calculation are generally quick at every other kind of knowledge and even the dull if they have had an arithmetical training although they may derive no other advantage from it always become much quicker than they would otherwise have been
very true he said
and indeed you will not easily find a more difficult study and not many as difficult
you will not
and for all these reasons arithmetic is a kind of knowledge in which the best natures should be trained and which must not be given up
i agree
let this then be made one of our subjects of education
and next shall we enquire whether the kindred science also concerns us
you mean geometry
exactly so
clearly he said we are concerned with that part of geometry which relates to war for in pitching a camp or taking up a position or closing or extending the lines of an army or any other military manoeuvre whether in actual battle or on a march it will make all the difference whether a general is or is not a geometrician
yes i said but for that purpose a very little of either geometry or calculation will be enough the question relates rather to the greater and more advanced part of geometry whether that tends in any degree to make more easy the vision of the idea of good and thither as i was saying all things tend which compel the soul to turn her gaze towards that place where is the full perfection of being which she ought by all means to behold
true he said
then if geometry compels us to view being it concerns us if becoming only it does not concern us
yes that is what we assert
yet anybody who has the least acquaintance with geometry will not deny that such a conception of the science is in flat contradiction to the ordinary language of geometricians
how so
they have in view practice only and are always speaking in a narrow and ridiculous manner of squaring and extending and applying and the like they confuse the necessities of geometry with those of daily life whereas knowledge is the real object of the whole science
certainly he said
then must not a further admission be made
what admission
that the knowledge at which geometry aims is knowledge of the eternal and not of aught perishing and transient
that he replied may be readily allowed and is true
then my noble friend geometry will draw the soul towards truth and create the spirit of philosophy and raise up that which is now unhappily allowed to fall down
nothing will be more likely to have such an effect
then nothing should be more sternly laid down than that the inhabitants of your fair city should by all means learn geometry
moreover the science has indirect effects which are not small
of what kind
he said
there are the military advantages of which you spoke i said and in all departments of knowledge as experience proves any one who has studied geometry is infinitely quicker of apprehension than one who has not
yes indeed he said there is an infinite difference between them
then shall we propose this as a second branch of knowledge which our youth will study
let us do so he replied
and suppose we make astronomy the third what do you say
i am strongly inclined to it he said the observation of the seasons and of months and years is as essential to the general as it is to the farmer or sailor
i am amused i said at your fear of the world which makes you guard against the appearance of insisting upon useless studies and i quite admit the difficulty of believing that in every man there is an eye of the soul which when by other pursuits lost and dimmed is by these purified and re illumined and is more precious far than ten thousand bodily eyes for by it alone is truth seen
now there are two classes of persons one class of those who will agree with you and will take your words as a revelation another class to whom they will be utterly unmeaning and who will naturally deem them to be idle tales for they see no sort of profit which is to be obtained from them
and therefore you had better decide at once with which of the two you are proposing to argue
you will very likely say with neither and that your chief aim in carrying on the argument is your own improvement at the same time you do not grudge to others any benefit which they may receive
i think that i should prefer to carry on the argument mainly on my own behalf
then take a step backward for we have gone wrong in the order of the sciences
what was the mistake
he said
after plane geometry i said we proceeded at once to solids in revolution instead of taking solids in themselves whereas after the second dimension the third which is concerned with cubes and dimensions of depth ought to have followed
that is true socrates but so little seems to be known as yet about these subjects
why yes i said and for two reasons in the first place no government patronises them this leads to a want of energy in the pursuit of them and they are difficult in the second place students cannot learn them unless they have a director
but then a director can hardly be found and even if he could as matters now stand the students who are very conceited would not attend to him
that however would be otherwise if the whole state became the director of these studies and gave honour to them then disciples would want to come and there would be continuous and earnest search and discoveries would be made since even now disregarded as they are by the world and maimed of their fair proportions and although none of their votaries can tell the use of them still these studies force their way by their natural charm and very likely if they had the help of the state they would some day emerge into light
yes he said there is a remarkable charm in them
but i do not clearly understand the change in the order
first you began with a geometry of plane surfaces
yes i said
and you placed astronomy next and then you made a step backward
yes and i have delayed you by my hurry the ludicrous state of solid geometry which in natural order should have followed made me pass over this branch and go on to astronomy or motion of solids
true he said
then assuming that the science now omitted would come into existence if encouraged by the state let us go on to astronomy which will be fourth
the right order he replied
and now socrates as you rebuked the vulgar manner in which i praised astronomy before my praise shall be given in your own spirit
for every one as i think must see that astronomy compels the soul to look upwards and leads us from this world to another
every one but myself i said to every one else this may be clear but not to me
and what then would you say
i should rather say that those who elevate astronomy into philosophy appear to me to make us look downwards and not upwards
what do you mean
he asked
you i replied have in your mind a truly sublime conception of our knowledge of the things above
and i dare say that if a person were to throw his head back and study the fretted ceiling you would still think that his mind was the percipient and not his eyes
and you are very likely right and i may be a simpleton but in my opinion that knowledge only which is of being and of the unseen can make the soul look upwards and whether a man gapes at the heavens or blinks on the ground seeking to learn some particular of sense i would deny that he can learn for nothing of that sort is matter of science his soul is looking downwards not upwards whether his way to knowledge is by water or by land whether he floats or only lies on his back
i acknowledge he said the justice of your rebuke
still i should like to ascertain how astronomy can be learned in any manner more conducive to that knowledge of which we are speaking
i will tell you i said the starry heaven which we behold is wrought upon a visible ground and therefore although the fairest and most perfect of visible things must necessarily be deemed inferior far to the true motions of absolute swiftness and absolute slowness which are relative to each other and carry with them that which is contained in them in the true number and in every true figure
now these are to be apprehended by reason and intelligence but not by sight
true he replied
the spangled heavens should be used as a pattern and with a view to that higher knowledge their beauty is like the beauty of figures or pictures excellently wrought by the hand of daedalus or some other great artist which we may chance to behold any geometrician who saw them would appreciate the exquisiteness of their workmanship but he would never dream of thinking that in them he could find the true equal or the true double or the truth of any other proportion
no he replied such an idea would be ridiculous
and will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks at the movements of the stars
will he not think that heaven and the things in heaven are framed by the creator of them in the most perfect manner
but he will never imagine that the proportions of night and day or of both to the month or of the month to the year or of the stars to these and to one another and any other things that are material and visible can also be eternal and subject to no deviation that would be absurd and it is equally absurd to take so much pains in investigating their exact truth
i quite agree though i never thought of this before
then i said in astronomy as in geometry we should employ problems and let the heavens alone if we would approach the subject in the right way and so make the natural gift of reason to be of any real use
that he said is a work infinitely beyond our present astronomers
yes i said and there are many other things which must also have a similar extension given to them if our legislation is to be of any value
but can you tell me of any other suitable study
no he said not without thinking
motion i said has many forms and not one only two of them are obvious enough even to wits no better than ours and there are others as i imagine which may be left to wiser persons
but where are the two
there is a second i said which is the counterpart of the one already named
and what may that be
the second i said would seem relatively to the ears to be what the first is to the eyes for i conceive that as the eyes are designed to look up at the stars so are the ears to hear harmonious motions and these are sister sciences as the pythagoreans say and we glaucon agree with them
yes he replied
but this i said is a laborious study and therefore we had better go and learn of them and they will tell us whether there are any other applications of these sciences
at the same time we must not lose sight of our own higher object
what is that
there is a perfection which all knowledge ought to reach and which our pupils ought also to attain and not to fall short of as i was saying that they did in astronomy
for in the science of harmony as you probably know the same thing happens
the teachers of harmony compare the sounds and consonances which are heard only and their labour like that of the astronomers is in vain
yes by heaven
he said and tis as good as a play to hear them talking about their condensed notes as they call them they put their ears close alongside of the strings like persons catching a sound from their neighbour s wall one set of them declaring that they distinguish an intermediate note and have found the least interval which should be the unit of measurement the others insisting that the two sounds have passed into the same either party setting their ears before their understanding
you mean i said those gentlemen who tease and torture the strings and rack them on the pegs of the instrument i might carry on the metaphor and speak after their manner of the blows which the plectrum gives and make accusations against the strings both of backwardness and forwardness to sound but this would be tedious and therefore i will only say that these are not the men and that i am referring to the pythagoreans of whom i was just now proposing to enquire about harmony
for they too are in error like the astronomers they investigate the numbers of the harmonies which are heard but they never attain to problems that is to say they never reach the natural harmonies of number or reflect why some numbers are harmonious and others not
that he said is a thing of more than mortal knowledge
a thing i replied which i would rather call useful that is if sought after with a view to the beautiful and good but if pursued in any other spirit useless
very true he said
now when all these studies reach the point of inter communion and connection with one another and come to be considered in their mutual affinities then i think but not till then will the pursuit of them have a value for our objects otherwise there is no profit in them
i suspect so but you are speaking socrates of a vast work
what do you mean
i said the prelude or what
do you not know that all this is but the prelude to the actual strain which we have to learn
for you surely would not regard the skilled mathematician as a dialectician
assuredly not he said i have hardly ever known a mathematician who was capable of reasoning
but do you imagine that men who are unable to give and take a reason will have the knowledge which we require of them
neither can this be supposed
and so glaucon i said we have at last arrived at the hymn of dialectic
this is that strain which is of the intellect only but which the faculty of sight will nevertheless be found to imitate for sight as you may remember was imagined by us after a while to behold the real animals and stars and last of all the sun himself
and so with dialectic when a person starts on the discovery of the absolute by the light of reason only and without any assistance of sense and perseveres until by pure intelligence he arrives at the perception of the absolute good he at last finds himself at the end of the intellectual world as in the case of sight at the end of the visible
exactly he said
then this is the progress which you call dialectic
true
but the release of the prisoners from chains and their translation from the shadows to the images and to the light and the ascent from the underground den to the sun while in his presence they are vainly trying to look on animals and plants and the light of the sun but are able to perceive even with their weak eyes the images in the water and are the shadows of true existence this power of elevating the highest principle in the soul to the contemplation of that which is best in existence with which we may compare the raising of that faculty which is the very light of the body to the sight of that which is brightest in the material and visible world this power is given as i was saying by all that study and pursuit of the arts which has been described
i agree in what you are saying he replied which may be hard to believe yet from another point of view is harder still to deny
this however is not a theme to be treated of in passing only but will have to be discussed again and again
and so whether our conclusion be true or false let us assume all this and proceed at once from the prelude or preamble to the chief strain and describe that in like manner
say then what is the nature and what are the divisions of dialectic and what are the paths which lead thither for these paths will also lead to our final rest
dear glaucon i said you will not be able to follow me here though i would do my best and you should behold not an image only but the absolute truth according to my notion
whether what i told you would or would not have been a reality i cannot venture to say but you would have seen something like reality of that i am confident
doubtless he replied
but i must also remind you that the power of dialectic alone can reveal this and only to one who is a disciple of the previous sciences
of that assertion you may be as confident as of the last
and assuredly no one will argue that there is any other method of comprehending by any regular process all true existence or of ascertaining what each thing is in its own nature for the arts in general are concerned with the desires or opinions of men or are cultivated with a view to production and construction or for the preservation of such productions and constructions and as to the mathematical sciences which as we were saying have some apprehension of true being geometry and the like they only dream about being but never can they behold the waking reality so long as they leave the hypotheses which they use unexamined and are unable to give an account of them
for when a man knows not his own first principle and when the conclusion and intermediate steps are also constructed out of he knows not what how can he imagine that such a fabric of convention can ever become science
impossible he said
then dialectic and dialectic alone goes directly to the first principle and is the only science which does away with hypotheses in order to make her ground secure the eye of the soul which is literally buried in an outlandish slough is by her gentle aid lifted upwards and she uses as handmaids and helpers in the work of conversion the sciences which we have been discussing
custom terms them sciences but they ought to have some other name implying greater clearness than opinion and less clearness than science and this in our previous sketch was called understanding
but why should we dispute about names when we have realities of such importance to consider
why indeed he said when any name will do which expresses the thought of the mind with clearness
at any rate we are satisfied as before to have four divisions two for intellect and two for opinion and to call the first division science the second understanding the third belief and the fourth perception of shadows opinion being concerned with becoming and intellect with being and so to make a proportion as being is to becoming so is pure intellect to opinion
and as intellect is to opinion so is science to belief and understanding to the perception of shadows
but let us defer the further correlation and subdivision of the subjects of opinion and of intellect for it will be a long enquiry many times longer than this has been
as far as i understand he said i agree
and do you also agree i said in describing the dialectician as one who attains a conception of the essence of each thing
and he who does not possess and is therefore unable to impart this conception in whatever degree he fails may in that degree also be said to fail in intelligence
will you admit so much
yes he said how can i deny it
and you would say the same of the conception of the good
until the person is able to abstract and define rationally the idea of good and unless he can run the gauntlet of all objections and is ready to disprove them not by appeals to opinion but to absolute truth never faltering at any step of the argument unless he can do all this you would say that he knows neither the idea of good nor any other good he apprehends only a shadow if anything at all which is given by opinion and not by science dreaming and slumbering in this life before he is well awake here he arrives at the world below and has his final quietus
in all that i should most certainly agree with you
and surely you would not have the children of your ideal state whom you are nurturing and educating if the ideal ever becomes a reality you would not allow the future rulers to be like posts having no reason in them and yet to be set in authority over the highest matters
certainly not
then you will make a law that they shall have such an education as will enable them to attain the greatest skill in asking and answering questions
yes he said you and i together will make it
dialectic then as you will agree is the coping stone of the sciences and is set over them no other science can be placed higher the nature of knowledge can no further go
i agree he said
but to whom we are to assign these studies and in what way they are to be assigned are questions which remain to be considered
yes clearly
you remember i said how the rulers were chosen before
certainly he said
the same natures must still be chosen and the preference again given to the surest and the bravest and if possible to the fairest and having noble and generous tempers they should also have the natural gifts which will facilitate their education
and what are these
such gifts as keenness and ready powers of acquisition for the mind more often faints from the severity of study than from the severity of gymnastics the toil is more entirely the mind s own and is not shared with the body
very true he replied
further he of whom we are in search should have a good memory and be an unwearied solid man who is a lover of labour in any line or he will never be able to endure the great amount of bodily exercise and to go through all the intellectual discipline and study which we require of him
certainly he said he must have natural gifts
the mistake at present is that those who study philosophy have no vocation and this as i was before saying is the reason why she has fallen into disrepute her true sons should take her by the hand and not bastards
what do you mean
in the first place her votary should not have a lame or halting industry i mean that he should not be half industrious and half idle as for example when a man is a lover of gymnastic and hunting and all other bodily exercises but a hater rather than a lover of the labour of learning or listening or enquiring
or the occupation to which he devotes himself may be of an opposite kind and he may have the other sort of lameness
certainly he said
and as to truth i said is not a soul equally to be deemed halt and lame which hates voluntary falsehood and is extremely indignant at herself and others when they tell lies but is patient of involuntary falsehood and does not mind wallowing like a swinish beast in the mire of ignorance and has no shame at being detected
to be sure
and again in respect of temperance courage magnificence and every other virtue should we not carefully distinguish between the true son and the bastard
for where there is no discernment of such qualities states and individuals unconsciously err and the state makes a ruler and the individual a friend of one who being defective in some part of virtue is in a figure lame or a bastard
that is very true he said
all these things then will have to be carefully considered by us and if only those whom we introduce to this vast system of education and training are sound in body and mind justice herself will have nothing to say against us and we shall be the saviours of the constitution and of the state but if our pupils are men of another stamp the reverse will happen and we shall pour a still greater flood of ridicule on philosophy than she has to endure at present
that would not be creditable
certainly not i said and yet perhaps in thus turning jest into earnest i am equally ridiculous
in what respect
i had forgotten i said that we were not serious and spoke with too much excitement
for when i saw philosophy so undeservedly trampled under foot of men i could not help feeling a sort of indignation at the authors of her disgrace and my anger made me too vehement
indeed
i was listening and did not think so
but i who am the speaker felt that i was
and now let me remind you that although in our former selection we chose old men we must not do so in this
solon was under a delusion when he said that a man when he grows old may learn many things for he can no more learn much than he can run much youth is the time for any extraordinary toil
of course
and therefore calculation and geometry and all the other elements of instruction which are a preparation for dialectic should be presented to the mind in childhood not however under any notion of forcing our system of education
why not
because a freeman ought not to be a slave in the acquisition of knowledge of any kind
bodily exercise when compulsory does no harm to the body but knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the mind
very true
then my good friend i said do not use compulsion but let early education be a sort of amusement you will then be better able to find out the natural bent
that is a very rational notion he said
do you remember that the children too were to be taken to see the battle on horseback and that if there were no danger they were to be brought close up and like young hounds have a taste of blood given them
yes i remember
the same practice may be followed i said in all these things labours lessons dangers and he who is most at home in all of them ought to be enrolled in a select number
at what age
at the age when the necessary gymnastics are over the period whether of two or three years which passes in this sort of training is useless for any other purpose for sleep and exercise are unpropitious to learning and the trial of who is first in gymnastic exercises is one of the most important tests to which our youth are subjected
certainly he replied
after that time those who are selected from the class of twenty years old will be promoted to higher honour and the sciences which they learned without any order in their early education will now be brought together and they will be able to see the natural relationship of them to one another and to true being
yes he said that is the only kind of knowledge which takes lasting root
yes i said and the capacity for such knowledge is the great criterion of dialectical talent the comprehensive mind is always the dialectical
i agree with you he said
these i said are the points which you must consider and those who have most of this comprehension and who are most steadfast in their learning and in their military and other appointed duties when they have arrived at the age of thirty have to be chosen by you out of the select class and elevated to higher honour and you will have to prove them by the help of dialectic in order to learn which of them is able to give up the use of sight and the other senses and in company with truth to attain absolute being and here my friend great caution is required
why great caution
do you not remark i said how great is the evil which dialectic has introduced
what evil
he said
the students of the art are filled with lawlessness
quite true he said
do you think that there is anything so very unnatural or inexcusable in their case
or will you make allowance for them
in what way make allowance
i want you i said by way of parallel to imagine a supposititious son who is brought up in great wealth he is one of a great and numerous family and has many flatterers
when he grows up to manhood he learns that his alleged are not his real parents but who the real are he is unable to discover
can you guess how he will be likely to behave towards his flatterers and his supposed parents first of all during the period when he is ignorant of the false relation and then again when he knows
or shall i guess for you
if you please
then i should say that while he is ignorant of the truth he will be likely to honour his father and his mother and his supposed relations more than the flatterers he will be less inclined to neglect them when in need or to do or say anything against them and he will be less willing to disobey them in any important matter
he will
but when he has made the discovery i should imagine that he would diminish his honour and regard for them and would become more devoted to the flatterers their influence over him would greatly increase he would now live after their ways and openly associate with them and unless he were of an unusually good disposition he would trouble himself no more about his supposed parents or other relations
well all that is very probable
but how is the image applicable to the disciples of philosophy
in this way you know that there are certain principles about justice and honour which were taught us in childhood and under their parental authority we have been brought up obeying and honouring them
that is true
there are also opposite maxims and habits of pleasure which flatter and attract the soul but do not influence those of us who have any sense of right and they continue to obey and honour the maxims of their fathers
true
now when a man is in this state and the questioning spirit asks what is fair or honourable and he answers as the legislator has taught him and then arguments many and diverse refute his words until he is driven into believing that nothing is honourable any more than dishonourable or just and good any more than the reverse and so of all the notions which he most valued do you think that he will still honour and obey them as before
impossible
and when he ceases to think them honourable and natural as heretofore and he fails to discover the true can he be expected to pursue any life other than that which flatters his desires
he cannot
and from being a keeper of the law he is converted into a breaker of it
unquestionably
now all this is very natural in students of philosophy such as i have described and also as i was just now saying most excusable
yes he said and i may add pitiable
therefore that your feelings may not be moved to pity about our citizens who are now thirty years of age every care must be taken in introducing them to dialectic
certainly
there is a danger lest they should taste the dear delight too early for youngsters as you may have observed when they first get the taste in their mouths argue for amusement and are always contradicting and refuting others in imitation of those who refute them like puppy dogs they rejoice in pulling and tearing at all who come near them
yes he said there is nothing which they like better
and when they have made many conquests and received defeats at the hands of many they violently and speedily get into a way of not believing anything which they believed before and hence not only they but philosophy and all that relates to it is apt to have a bad name with the rest of the world
too true he said
but when a man begins to get older he will no longer be guilty of such insanity he will imitate the dialectician who is seeking for truth and not the eristic who is contradicting for the sake of amusement and the greater moderation of his character will increase instead of diminishing the honour of the pursuit
very true he said
and did we not make special provision for this when we said that the disciples of philosophy were to be orderly and steadfast not as now any chance aspirant or intruder
very true
suppose i said the study of philosophy to take the place of gymnastics and to be continued diligently and earnestly and exclusively for twice the number of years which were passed in bodily exercise will that be enough
would you say six or four years
he asked
say five years i replied at the end of the time they must be sent down again into the den and compelled to hold any military or other office which young men are qualified to hold in this way they will get their experience of life and there will be an opportunity of trying whether when they are drawn all manner of ways by temptation they will stand firm or flinch
and how long is this stage of their lives to last
fifteen years i answered and when they have reached fifty years of age then let those who still survive and have distinguished themselves in every action of their lives and in every branch of knowledge come at last to their consummation the time has now arrived at which they must raise the eye of the soul to the universal light which lightens all things and behold the absolute good for that is the pattern according to which they are to order the state and the lives of individuals and the remainder of their own lives also making philosophy their chief pursuit but when their turn comes toiling also at politics and ruling for the public good not as though they were performing some heroic action but simply as a matter of duty and when they have brought up in each generation others like themselves and left them in their place to be governors of the state then they will depart to the islands of the blest and dwell there and the city will give them public memorials and sacrifices and honour them if the pythian oracle consent as demigods but if not as in any case blessed and divine
you are a sculptor socrates and have made statues of our governors faultless in beauty
yes i said glaucon and of our governesses too for you must not suppose that what i have been saying applies to men only and not to women as far as their natures can go
there you are right he said since we have made them to share in all things like the men
well i said and you would agree that what has been said about the state and the government is not a mere dream and although difficult not impossible but only possible in the way which has been supposed that is to say when the true philosopher kings are born in a state one or more of them despising the honours of this present world which they deem mean and worthless esteeming above all things right and the honour that springs from right and regarding justice as the greatest and most necessary of all things whose ministers they are and whose principles will be exalted by them when they set in order their own city
how will they proceed
they will begin by sending out into the country all the inhabitants of the city who are more than ten years old and will take possession of their children who will be unaffected by the habits of their parents these they will train in their own habits and laws i mean in the laws which we have given them and in this way the state and constitution of which we were speaking will soonest and most easily attain happiness and the nation which has such a constitution will gain most
yes that will be the best way
and i think socrates that you have very well described how if ever such a constitution might come into being
enough then of the perfect state and of the man who bears its image there is no difficulty in seeing how we shall describe him
there is no difficulty he replied and i agree with you in thinking that nothing more need be said
book viii
and so glaucon we have arrived at the conclusion that in the perfect state wives and children are to be in common and that all education and the pursuits of war and peace are also to be common and the best philosophers and the bravest warriors are to be their kings
that replied glaucon has been acknowledged
yes i said and we have further acknowledged that the governors when appointed themselves will take their soldiers and place them in houses such as we were describing which are common to all and contain nothing private or individual and about their property you remember what we agreed
yes i remember that no one was to have any of the ordinary possessions of mankind they were to be warrior athletes and guardians receiving from the other citizens in lieu of annual payment only their maintenance and they were to take care of themselves and of the whole state
true i said and now that this division of our task is concluded let us find the point at which we digressed that we may return into the old path
there is no difficulty in returning you implied then as now that you had finished the description of the state you said that such a state was good and that the man was good who answered to it although as now appears you had more excellent things to relate both of state and man
and you said further that if this was the true form then the others were false and of the false forms you said as i remember that there were four principal ones and that their defects and the defects of the individuals corresponding to them were worth examining
when we had seen all the individuals and finally agreed as to who was the best and who was the worst of them we were to consider whether the best was not also the happiest and the worst the most miserable
i asked you what were the four forms of government of which you spoke and then polemarchus and adeimantus put in their word and you began again and have found your way to the point at which we have now arrived
your recollection i said is most exact
then like a wrestler he replied you must put yourself again in the same position and let me ask the same questions and do you give me the same answer which you were about to give me then
yes if i can i will i said
i shall particularly wish to hear what were the four constitutions of which you were speaking
that question i said is easily answered the four governments of which i spoke so far as they have distinct names are first those of crete and sparta which are generally applauded what is termed oligarchy comes next this is not equally approved and is a form of government which teems with evils thirdly democracy which naturally follows oligarchy although very different and lastly comes tyranny great and famous which differs from them all and is the fourth and worst disorder of a state
i do not know do you
of any other constitution which can be said to have a distinct character
there are lordships and principalities which are bought and sold and some other intermediate forms of government
but these are nondescripts and may be found equally among hellenes and among barbarians
yes he replied we certainly hear of many curious forms of government which exist among them
do you know i said that governments vary as the dispositions of men vary and that there must be as many of the one as there are of the other
for we cannot suppose that states are made of oak and rock and not out of the human natures which are in them and which in a figure turn the scale and draw other things after them
yes he said the states are as the men are they grow out of human characters
then if the constitutions of states are five the dispositions of individual minds will also be five
certainly
him who answers to aristocracy and whom we rightly call just and good we have already described
we have
then let us now proceed to describe the inferior sort of natures being the contentious and ambitious who answer to the spartan polity also the oligarchical democratical and tyrannical
let us place the most just by the side of the most unjust and when we see them we shall be able to compare the relative happiness or unhappiness of him who leads a life of pure justice or pure injustice
the enquiry will then be completed
and we shall know whether we ought to pursue injustice as thrasymachus advises or in accordance with the conclusions of the argument to prefer justice
certainly he replied we must do as you say
shall we follow our old plan which we adopted with a view to clearness of taking the state first and then proceeding to the individual and begin with the government of honour
i know of no name for such a government other than timocracy or perhaps timarchy
we will compare with this the like character in the individual and after that consider oligarchy and the oligarchical man and then again we will turn our attention to democracy and the democratical man and lastly we will go and view the city of tyranny and once more take a look into the tyrant s soul and try to arrive at a satisfactory decision
that way of viewing and judging of the matter will be very suitable
first then i said let us enquire how timocracy arises out of aristocracy 
clearly all political changes originate in divisions of the actual governing power a government which is united however small cannot be moved
very true he said
in what way then will our city be moved and in what manner will the two classes of auxiliaries and rulers disagree among themselves or with one another
shall we after the manner of homer pray the muses to tell us how discord first arose 
shall we imagine them in solemn mockery to play and jest with us as if we were children and to address us in a lofty tragic vein making believe to be in earnest
how would they address us
after this manner a city which is thus constituted can hardly be shaken but seeing that everything which has a beginning has also an end even a constitution such as yours will not last for ever but will in time be dissolved
and this is the dissolution in plants that grow in the earth as well as in animals that move on the earth s surface fertility and sterility of soul and body occur when the circumferences of the circles of each are completed which in short lived existences pass over a short space and in long lived ones over a long space
but to the knowledge of human fecundity and sterility all the wisdom and education of your rulers will not attain the laws which regulate them will not be discovered by an intelligence which is alloyed with sense but will escape them and they will bring children into the world when they ought not
now that which is of divine birth has a period which is contained in a perfect number but the period of human birth is comprehended in a number in which first increments by involution and evolution obtaining three intervals and four terms of like and unlike waxing and waning numbers make all the terms commensurable and agreeable to one another
the base of these with a third added when combined with five and raised to the third power furnishes two harmonies the first a square which is a hundred times as great and the other a figure having one side equal to the former but oblong consisting of a hundred numbers squared upon rational diameters of a square the side of which is five each of them being less by one or less by two perfect squares of irrational diameters and a hundred cubes of three 
now this number represents a geometrical figure which has control over the good and evil of births
for when your guardians are ignorant of the law of births and unite bride and bridegroom out of season the children will not be goodly or fortunate
and though only the best of them will be appointed by their predecessors still they will be unworthy to hold their fathers places and when they come into power as guardians they will soon be found to fail in taking care of us the muses first by under valuing music which neglect will soon extend to gymnastic and hence the young men of your state will be less cultivated
in the succeeding generation rulers will be appointed who have lost the guardian power of testing the metal of your different races which like hesiod s are of gold and silver and brass and iron
and so iron will be mingled with silver and brass with gold and hence there will arise dissimilarity and inequality and irregularity which always and in all places are causes of hatred and war
this the muses affirm to be the stock from which discord has sprung wherever arising and this is their answer to us
yes and we may assume that they answer truly
why yes i said of course they answer truly how can the muses speak falsely
and what do the muses say next
when discord arose then the two races were drawn different ways the iron and brass fell to acquiring money and land and houses and gold and silver but the gold and silver races not wanting money but having the true riches in their own nature inclined towards virtue and the ancient order of things
there was a battle between them and at last they agreed to distribute their land and houses among individual owners and they enslaved their friends and maintainers whom they had formerly protected in the condition of freemen and made of them subjects and servants and they themselves were engaged in war and in keeping a watch against them
i believe that you have rightly conceived the origin of the change
and the new government which thus arises will be of a form intermediate between oligarchy and aristocracy
very true
such will be the change and after the change has been made how will they proceed
clearly the new state being in a mean between oligarchy and the perfect state will partly follow one and partly the other and will also have some peculiarities
true he said
in the honour given to rulers in the abstinence of the warrior class from agriculture handicrafts and trade in general in the institution of common meals and in the attention paid to gymnastics and military training in all these respects this state will resemble the former
true
but in the fear of admitting philosophers to power because they are no longer to be had simple and earnest but are made up of mixed elements and in turning from them to passionate and less complex characters who are by nature fitted for war rather than peace and in the value set by them upon military stratagems and contrivances and in the waging of everlasting wars this state will be for the most part peculiar
yes
yes i said and men of this stamp will be covetous of money like those who live in oligarchies they will have a fierce secret longing after gold and silver which they will hoard in dark places having magazines and treasuries of their own for the deposit and concealment of them also castles which are just nests for their eggs and in which they will spend large sums on their wives or on any others whom they please
that is most true he said
and they are miserly because they have no means of openly acquiring the money which they prize they will spend that which is another man s on the gratification of their desires stealing their pleasures and running away like children from the law their father they have been schooled not by gentle influences but by force for they have neglected her who is the true muse the companion of reason and philosophy and have honoured gymnastic more than music
undoubtedly he said the form of government which you describe is a mixture of good and evil
why there is a mixture i said but one thing and one thing only is predominantly seen the spirit of contention and ambition and these are due to the prevalence of the passionate or spirited element
assuredly he said
such is the origin and such the character of this state which has been described in outline only the more perfect execution was not required for a sketch is enough to show the type of the most perfectly just and most perfectly unjust and to go through all the states and all the characters of men omitting none of them would be an interminable labour
very true he replied
now what man answers to this form of government how did he come into being and what is he like
i think said adeimantus that in the spirit of contention which characterises him he is not unlike our friend glaucon
perhaps i said he may be like him in that one point but there are other respects in which he is very different
in what respects
he should have more of self assertion and be less cultivated and yet a friend of culture and he should be a good listener but no speaker
such a person is apt to be rough with slaves unlike the educated man who is too proud for that and he will also be courteous to freemen and remarkably obedient to authority he is a lover of power and a lover of honour claiming to be a ruler not because he is eloquent or on any ground of that sort but because he is a soldier and has performed feats of arms he is also a lover of gymnastic exercises and of the chase
yes that is the type of character which answers to timocracy
such an one will despise riches only when he is young but as he gets older he will be more and more attracted to them because he has a piece of the avaricious nature in him and is not single minded towards virtue having lost his best guardian
who was that
said adeimantus
philosophy i said tempered with music who comes and takes up her abode in a man and is the only saviour of his virtue throughout life
good he said
such i said is the timocratical youth and he is like the timocratical state
exactly
his origin is as follows he is often the young son of a brave father who dwells in an ill governed city of which he declines the honours and offices and will not go to law or exert himself in any way but is ready to waive his rights in order that he may escape trouble
and how does the son come into being
the character of the son begins to develope when he hears his mother complaining that her husband has no place in the government of which the consequence is that she has no precedence among other women
further when she sees her husband not very eager about money and instead of battling and railing in the law courts or assembly taking whatever happens to him quietly and when she observes that his thoughts always centre in himself while he treats her with very considerable indifference she is annoyed and says to her son that his father is only half a man and far too easy going adding all the other complaints about her own ill treatment which women are so fond of rehearsing
yes said adeimantus they give us plenty of them and their complaints are so like themselves
and you know i said that the old servants also who are supposed to be attached to the family from time to time talk privately in the same strain to the son and if they see any one who owes money to his father or is wronging him in any way and he fails to prosecute them they tell the youth that when he grows up he must retaliate upon people of this sort and be more of a man than his father
he has only to walk abroad and he hears and sees the same sort of thing those who do their own business in the city are called simpletons and held in no esteem while the busy bodies are honoured and applauded
the result is that the young man hearing and seeing all these things hearing too the words of his father and having a nearer view of his way of life and making comparisons of him and others is drawn opposite ways while his father is watering and nourishing the rational principle in his soul the others are encouraging the passionate and appetitive and he being not originally of a bad nature but having kept bad company is at last brought by their joint influence to a middle point and gives up the kingdom which is within him to the middle principle of contentiousness and passion and becomes arrogant and ambitious
you seem to me to have described his origin perfectly
then we have now i said the second form of government and the second type of character
we have
next let us look at another man who as aeschylus says is set over against another state or rather as our plan requires begin with the state
by all means
i believe that oligarchy follows next in order
and what manner of government do you term oligarchy
a government resting on a valuation of property in which the rich have power and the poor man is deprived of it
i understand he replied
ought i not to begin by describing how the change from timocracy to oligarchy arises
yes
well i said no eyes are required in order to see how the one passes into the other
how
the accumulation of gold in the treasury of private individuals is the ruin of timocracy they invent illegal modes of expenditure for what do they or their wives care about the law
yes indeed
and then one seeing another grow rich seeks to rival him and thus the great mass of the citizens become lovers of money
likely enough
and so they grow richer and richer and the more they think of making a fortune the less they think of virtue for when riches and virtue are placed together in the scales of the balance the one always rises as the other falls
true
and in proportion as riches and rich men are honoured in the state virtue and the virtuous are dishonoured
clearly
and what is honoured is cultivated and that which has no honour is neglected
that is obvious
and so at last instead of loving contention and glory men become lovers of trade and money they honour and look up to the rich man and make a ruler of him and dishonour the poor man
they do so
they next proceed to make a law which fixes a sum of money as the qualification of citizenship the sum is higher in one place and lower in another as the oligarchy is more or less exclusive and they allow no one whose property falls below the amount fixed to have any share in the government
these changes in the constitution they effect by force of arms if intimidation has not already done their work
very true
and this speaking generally is the way in which oligarchy is established
yes he said but what are the characteristics of this form of government and what are the defects of which we were speaking
first of all i said consider the nature of the qualification
just think what would happen if pilots were to be chosen according to their property and a poor man were refused permission to steer even though he were a better pilot
you mean that they would shipwreck
yes and is not this true of the government of anything
i should imagine so
except a city
or would you include a city
nay he said the case of a city is the strongest of all inasmuch as the rule of a city is the greatest and most difficult of all
this then will be the first great defect of oligarchy
clearly
and here is another defect which is quite as bad
what defect
the inevitable division such a state is not one but two states the one of poor the other of rich men and they are living on the same spot and always conspiring against one another
that surely is at least as bad
another discreditable feature is that for a like reason they are incapable of carrying on any war
either they arm the multitude and then they are more afraid of them than of the enemy or if they do not call them out in the hour of battle they are oligarchs indeed few to fight as they are few to rule
and at the same time their fondness for money makes them unwilling to pay taxes
how discreditable
and as we said before under such a constitution the same persons have too many callings they are husbandmen tradesmen warriors all in one
does that look well
anything but well
there is another evil which is perhaps the greatest of all and to which this state first begins to be liable
what evil
a man may sell all that he has and another may acquire his property yet after the sale he may dwell in the city of which he is no longer a part being neither trader nor artisan nor horseman nor hoplite but only a poor helpless creature
yes that is an evil which also first begins in this state
the evil is certainly not prevented there for oligarchies have both the extremes of great wealth and utter poverty
true
but think again in his wealthy days while he was spending his money was a man of this sort a whit more good to the state for the purposes of citizenship
or did he only seem to be a member of the ruling body although in truth he was neither ruler nor subject but just a spendthrift
as you say he seemed to be a ruler but was only a spendthrift
may we not say that this is the drone in the house who is like the drone in the honeycomb and that the one is the plague of the city as the other is of the hive
just so socrates
and god has made the flying drones adeimantus all without stings whereas of the walking drones he has made some without stings but others have dreadful stings of the stingless class are those who in their old age end as paupers of the stingers come all the criminal class as they are termed
most true he said
clearly then whenever you see paupers in a state somewhere in that neighborhood there are hidden away thieves and cut purses and robbers of temples and all sorts of malefactors
clearly
well i said and in oligarchical states do you not find paupers
yes he said nearly everybody is a pauper who is not a ruler
and may we be so bold as to affirm that there are also many criminals to be found in them rogues who have stings and whom the authorities are careful to restrain by force
certainly we may be so bold
the existence of such persons is to be attributed to want of education ill training and an evil constitution of the state
true
such then is the form and such are the evils of oligarchy and there may be many other evils
very likely
then oligarchy or the form of government in which the rulers are elected for their wealth may now be dismissed
let us next proceed to consider the nature and origin of the individual who answers to this state
by all means
does not the timocratical man change into the oligarchical on this wise
how
a time arrives when the representative of timocracy has a son at first he begins by emulating his father and walking in his footsteps but presently he sees him of a sudden foundering against the state as upon a sunken reef and he and all that he has is lost he may have been a general or some other high officer who is brought to trial under a prejudice raised by informers and either put to death or exiled or deprived of the privileges of a citizen and all his property taken from him
nothing more likely
and the son has seen and known all this he is a ruined man and his fear has taught him to knock ambition and passion headforemost from his bosom s throne humbled by poverty he takes to money making and by mean and miserly savings and hard work gets a fortune together
is not such an one likely to seat the concupiscent and covetous element on the vacant throne and to suffer it to play the great king within him girt with tiara and chain and scimitar
most true he replied
and when he has made reason and spirit sit down on the ground obediently on either side of their sovereign and taught them to know their place he compels the one to think only of how lesser sums may be turned into larger ones and will not allow the other to worship and admire anything but riches and rich men or to be ambitious of anything so much as the acquisition of wealth and the means of acquiring it
of all changes he said there is none so speedy or so sure as the conversion of the ambitious youth into the avaricious one
and the avaricious i said is the oligarchical youth
yes he said at any rate the individual out of whom he came is like the state out of which oligarchy came
let us then consider whether there is any likeness between them
very good
first then they resemble one another in the value which they set upon wealth
certainly
also in their penurious laborious character the individual only satisfies his necessary appetites and confines his expenditure to them his other desires he subdues under the idea that they are unprofitable
true
he is a shabby fellow who saves something out of everything and makes a purse for himself and this is the sort of man whom the vulgar applaud
is he not a true image of the state which he represents
he appears to me to be so at any rate money is highly valued by him as well as by the state
you see that he is not a man of cultivation i said
i imagine not he said had he been educated he would never have made a blind god director of his chorus or given him chief honour
excellent
i said
yet consider must we not further admit that owing to this want of cultivation there will be found in him dronelike desires as of pauper and rogue which are forcibly kept down by his general habit of life
true
do you know where you will have to look if you want to discover his rogueries
where must i look
you should see him where he has some great opportunity of acting dishonestly as in the guardianship of an orphan
aye
it will be clear enough then that in his ordinary dealings which give him a reputation for honesty he coerces his bad passions by an enforced virtue not making them see that they are wrong or taming them by reason but by necessity and fear constraining them and because he trembles for his possessions
to be sure
yes indeed my dear friend but you will find that the natural desires of the drone commonly exist in him all the same whenever he has to spend what is not his own
yes and they will be strong in him too
the man then will be at war with himself he will be two men and not one but in general his better desires will be found to prevail over his inferior ones
true
for these reasons such an one will be more respectable than most people yet the true virtue of a unanimous and harmonious soul will flee far away and never come near him
i should expect so
and surely the miser individually will be an ignoble competitor in a state for any prize of victory or other object of honourable ambition he will not spend his money in the contest for glory so afraid is he of awakening his expensive appetites and inviting them to help and join in the struggle in true oligarchical fashion he fights with a small part only of his resources and the result commonly is that he loses the prize and saves his money
very true
can we any longer doubt then that the miser and money maker answers to the oligarchical state
there can be no doubt
next comes democracy of this the origin and nature have still to be considered by us and then we will enquire into the ways of the democratic man and bring him up for judgment
that he said is our method
well i said and how does the change from oligarchy into democracy arise
is it not on this wise
the good at which such a state aims is to become as rich as possible a desire which is insatiable
what then
the rulers being aware that their power rests upon their wealth refuse to curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth because they gain by their ruin they take interest from them and buy up their estates and thus increase their own wealth and importance
to be sure
there can be no doubt that the love of wealth and the spirit of moderation cannot exist together in citizens of the same state to any considerable extent one or the other will be disregarded
that is tolerably clear
and in oligarchical states from the general spread of carelessness and extravagance men of good family have often been reduced to beggary
yes often
and still they remain in the city there they are ready to sting and fully armed and some of them owe money some have forfeited their citizenship a third class are in both predicaments and they hate and conspire against those who have got their property and against everybody else and are eager for revolution
that is true
on the other hand the men of business stooping as they walk and pretending not even to see those whom they have already ruined insert their sting that is their money into some one else who is not on his guard against them and recover the parent sum many times over multiplied into a family of children and so they make drone and pauper to abound in the state
yes he said there are plenty of them that is certain
the evil blazes up like a fire and they will not extinguish it either by restricting a man s use of his own property or by another remedy what other
one which is the next best and has the advantage of compelling the citizens to look to their characters let there be a general rule that every one shall enter into voluntary contracts at his own risk and there will be less of this scandalous money making and the evils of which we were speaking will be greatly lessened in the state
yes they will be greatly lessened
at present the governors induced by the motives which i have named treat their subjects badly while they and their adherents especially the young men of the governing class are habituated to lead a life of luxury and idleness both of body and mind they do nothing and are incapable of resisting either pleasure or pain
very true
they themselves care only for making money and are as indifferent as the pauper to the cultivation of virtue
yes quite as indifferent
such is the state of affairs which prevails among them
and often rulers and their subjects may come in one another s way whether on a journey or on some other occasion of meeting on a pilgrimage or a march as fellow soldiers or fellow sailors aye and they may observe the behaviour of each other in the very moment of danger for where danger is there is no fear that the poor will be despised by the rich and very likely the wiry sunburnt poor man may be placed in battle at the side of a wealthy one who has never spoilt his complexion and has plenty of superfluous flesh when he sees such an one puffing and at his wits end how can he avoid drawing the conclusion that men like him are only rich because no one has the courage to despoil them
and when they meet in private will not people be saying to one another our warriors are not good for much 
yes he said i am quite aware that this is their way of talking
and as in a body which is diseased the addition of a touch from without may bring on illness and sometimes even when there is no external provocation a commotion may arise within in the same way wherever there is weakness in the state there is also likely to be illness of which the occasion may be very slight the one party introducing from without their oligarchical the other their democratical allies and then the state falls sick and is at war with herself and may be at times distracted even when there is no external cause
yes surely
and then democracy comes into being after the poor have conquered their opponents slaughtering some and banishing some while to the remainder they give an equal share of freedom and power and this is the form of government in which the magistrates are commonly elected by lot
yes he said that is the nature of democracy whether the revolution has been effected by arms or whether fear has caused the opposite party to withdraw
and now what is their manner of life and what sort of a government have they
for as the government is such will be the man
clearly he said
in the first place are they not free and is not the city full of freedom and frankness a man may say and do what he likes
tis said so he replied
and where freedom is the individual is clearly able to order for himself his own life as he pleases
clearly
then in this kind of state there will be the greatest variety of human natures
there will
this then seems likely to be the fairest of states being like an embroidered robe which is spangled with every sort of flower
and just as women and children think a variety of colours to be of all things most charming so there are many men to whom this state which is spangled with the manners and characters of mankind will appear to be the fairest of states
yes
yes my good sir and there will be no better in which to look for a government
why
because of the liberty which reigns there they have a complete assortment of constitutions and he who has a mind to establish a state as we have been doing must go to a democracy as he would to a bazaar at which they sell them and pick out the one that suits him then when he has made his choice he may found his state
he will be sure to have patterns enough
and there being no necessity i said for you to govern in this state even if you have the capacity or to be governed unless you like or go to war when the rest go to war or to be at peace when others are at peace unless you are so disposed there being no necessity also because some law forbids you to hold office or be a dicast that you should not hold office or be a dicast if you have a fancy is not this a way of life which for the moment is supremely delightful
for the moment yes
and is not their humanity to the condemned in some cases quite charming
have you not observed how in a democracy many persons although they have been sentenced to death or exile just stay where they are and walk about the world the gentleman parades like a hero and nobody sees or cares
yes he replied many and many a one
see too i said the forgiving spirit of democracy and the don t care about trifles and the disregard which she shows of all the fine principles which we solemnly laid down at the foundation of the city as when we said that except in the case of some rarely gifted nature there never will be a good man who has not from his childhood been used to play amid things of beauty and make of them a joy and a study how grandly does she trample all these fine notions of ours under her feet never giving a thought to the pursuits which make a statesman and promoting to honour any one who professes to be the people s friend
yes she is of a noble spirit
these and other kindred characteristics are proper to democracy which is a charming form of government full of variety and disorder and dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequals alike
we know her well
consider now i said what manner of man the individual is or rather consider as in the case of the state how he comes into being
very good he said
is not this the way he is the son of the miserly and oligarchical father who has trained him in his own habits
exactly
and like his father he keeps under by force the pleasures which are of the spending and not of the getting sort being those which are called unnecessary
obviously
would you like for the sake of clearness to distinguish which are the necessary and which are the unnecessary pleasures
i should
are not necessary pleasures those of which we cannot get rid and of which the satisfaction is a benefit to us
and they are rightly called so because we are framed by nature to desire both what is beneficial and what is necessary and cannot help it
true
we are not wrong therefore in calling them necessary
we are not
and the desires of which a man may get rid if he takes pains from his youth upwards of which the presence moreover does no good and in some cases the reverse of good shall we not be right in saying that all these are unnecessary
yes certainly
suppose we select an example of either kind in order that we may have a general notion of them
very good
will not the desire of eating that is of simple food and condiments in so far as they are required for health and strength be of the necessary class
that is what i should suppose
the pleasure of eating is necessary in two ways it does us good and it is essential to the continuance of life
yes
but the condiments are only necessary in so far as they are good for health
certainly
and the desire which goes beyond this of more delicate food or other luxuries which might generally be got rid of if controlled and trained in youth and is hurtful to the body and hurtful to the soul in the pursuit of wisdom and virtue may be rightly called unnecessary
very true
may we not say that these desires spend and that the others make money because they conduce to production
certainly
and of the pleasures of love and all other pleasures the same holds good
true
and the drone of whom we spoke was he who was surfeited in pleasures and desires of this sort and was the slave of the unnecessary desires whereas he who was subject to the necessary only was miserly and oligarchical
very true
again let us see how the democratical man grows out of the oligarchical the following as i suspect is commonly the process
what is the process
when a young man who has been brought up as we were just now describing in a vulgar and miserly way has tasted drones honey and has come to associate with fierce and crafty natures who are able to provide for him all sorts of refinements and varieties of pleasure then as you may imagine the change will begin of the oligarchical principle within him into the democratical
inevitably
and as in the city like was helping like and the change was effected by an alliance from without assisting one division of the citizens so too the young man is changed by a class of desires coming from without to assist the desires within him that which is akin and alike again helping that which is akin and alike
certainly
and if there be any ally which aids the oligarchical principle within him whether the influence of a father or of kindred advising or rebuking him then there arises in his soul a faction and an opposite faction and he goes to war with himself
it must be so
and there are times when the democratical principle gives way to the oligarchical and some of his desires die and others are banished a spirit of reverence enters into the young man s soul and order is restored
yes he said that sometimes happens
and then again after the old desires have been driven out fresh ones spring up which are akin to them and because he their father does not know how to educate them wax fierce and numerous
yes he said that is apt to be the way
they draw him to his old associates and holding secret intercourse with them breed and multiply in him
very true
at length they seize upon the citadel of the young man s soul which they perceive to be void of all accomplishments and fair pursuits and true words which make their abode in the minds of men who are dear to the gods and are their best guardians and sentinels
none better
false and boastful conceits and phrases mount upwards and take their place
they are certain to do so
and so the young man returns into the country of the lotus eaters and takes up his dwelling there in the face of all men and if any help be sent by his friends to the oligarchical part of him the aforesaid vain conceits shut the gate of the king s fastness and they will neither allow the embassy itself to enter nor if private advisers offer the fatherly counsel of the aged will they listen to them or receive them
there is a battle and they gain the day and then modesty which they call silliness is ignominiously thrust into exile by them and temperance which they nickname unmanliness is trampled in the mire and cast forth they persuade men that moderation and orderly expenditure are vulgarity and meanness and so by the help of a rabble of evil appetites they drive them beyond the border
yes with a will
and when they have emptied and swept clean the soul of him who is now in their power and who is being initiated by them in great mysteries the next thing is to bring back to their house insolence and anarchy and waste and impudence in bright array having garlands on their heads and a great company with them hymning their praises and calling them by sweet names insolence they term breeding and anarchy liberty and waste magnificence and impudence courage
and so the young man passes out of his original nature which was trained in the school of necessity into the freedom and libertinism of useless and unnecessary pleasures
yes he said the change in him is visible enough
after this he lives on spending his money and labour and time on unnecessary pleasures quite as much as on necessary ones but if he be fortunate and is not too much disordered in his wits when years have elapsed and the heyday of passion is over supposing that he then re admits into the city some part of the exiled virtues and does not wholly give himself up to their successors in that case he balances his pleasures and lives in a sort of equilibrium putting the government of himself into the hands of the one which comes first and wins the turn and when he has had enough of that then into the hands of another he despises none of them but encourages them all equally
very true he said
neither does he receive or let pass into the fortress any true word of advice if any one says to him that some pleasures are the satisfactions of good and noble desires and others of evil desires and that he ought to use and honour some and chastise and master the others whenever this is repeated to him he shakes his head and says that they are all alike and that one is as good as another
yes he said that is the way with him
yes i said he lives from day to day indulging the appetite of the hour and sometimes he is lapped in drink and strains of the flute then he becomes a water drinker and tries to get thin then he takes a turn at gymnastics sometimes idling and neglecting everything then once more living the life of a philosopher often he is busy with politics and starts to his feet and says and does whatever comes into his head and if he is emulous of any one who is a warrior off he is in that direction or of men of business once more in that
his life has neither law nor order and this distracted existence he terms joy and bliss and freedom and so he goes on
yes he replied he is all liberty and equality
yes i said his life is motley and manifold and an epitome of the lives of many he answers to the state which we described as fair and spangled
and many a man and many a woman will take him for their pattern and many a constitution and many an example of manners is contained in him
just so
let him then be set over against democracy he may truly be called the democratic man
let that be his place he said
last of all comes the most beautiful of all man and state alike tyranny and the tyrant these we have now to consider
quite true he said
say then my friend in what manner does tyranny arise
that it has a democratic origin is evident
clearly
and does not tyranny spring from democracy in the same manner as democracy from oligarchy i mean after a sort
how
the good which oligarchy proposed to itself and the means by which it was maintained was excess of wealth am i not right
yes
and the insatiable desire of wealth and the neglect of all other things for the sake of money getting was also the ruin of oligarchy
true
and democracy has her own good of which the insatiable desire brings her to dissolution
what good
freedom i replied which as they tell you in a democracy is the glory of the state and that therefore in a democracy alone will the freeman of nature deign to dwell
yes the saying is in every body s mouth
i was going to observe that the insatiable desire of this and the neglect of other things introduces the change in democracy which occasions a demand for tyranny
how so
when a democracy which is thirsting for freedom has evil cup bearers presiding over the feast and has drunk too deeply of the strong wine of freedom then unless her rulers are very amenable and give a plentiful draught she calls them to account and punishes them and says that they are cursed oligarchs
yes he replied a very common occurrence
yes i said and loyal citizens are insultingly termed by her slaves who hug their chains and men of naught she would have subjects who are like rulers and rulers who are like subjects these are men after her own heart whom she praises and honours both in private and public
now in such a state can liberty have any limit
certainly not
by degrees the anarchy finds a way into private houses and ends by getting among the animals and infecting them
how do you mean
i mean that the father grows accustomed to descend to the level of his sons and to fear them and the son is on a level with his father he having no respect or reverence for either of his parents and this is his freedom and the metic is equal with the citizen and the citizen with the metic and the stranger is quite as good as either
yes he said that is the way
and these are not the only evils i said there are several lesser ones in such a state of society the master fears and flatters his scholars and the scholars despise their masters and tutors young and old are all alike and the young man is on a level with the old and is ready to compete with him in word or deed and old men condescend to the young and are full of pleasantry and gaiety they are loth to be thought morose and authoritative and therefore they adopt the manners of the young
quite true he said
the last extreme of popular liberty is when the slave bought with money whether male or female is just as free as his or her purchaser nor must i forget to tell of the liberty and equality of the two sexes in relation to each other
why not as aeschylus says utter the word which rises to our lips
that is what i am doing i replied and i must add that no one who does not know would believe how much greater is the liberty which the animals who are under the dominion of man have in a democracy than in any other state for truly the she dogs as the proverb says are as good as their she mistresses and the horses and asses have a way of marching along with all the rights and dignities of freemen and they will run at any body who comes in their way if he does not leave the road clear for them and all things are just ready to burst with liberty
when i take a country walk he said i often experience what you describe
you and i have dreamed the same thing
and above all i said and as the result of all see how sensitive the citizens become they chafe impatiently at the least touch of authority and at length as you know they cease to care even for the laws written or unwritten they will have no one over them
yes he said i know it too well
such my friend i said is the fair and glorious beginning out of which springs tyranny
glorious indeed he said
but what is the next step
the ruin of oligarchy is the ruin of democracy the same disease magnified and intensified by liberty overmasters democracy the truth being that the excessive increase of anything often causes a reaction in the opposite direction and this is the case not only in the seasons and in vegetable and animal life but above all in forms of government
true
the excess of liberty whether in states or individuals seems only to pass into excess of slavery
yes the natural order
and so tyranny naturally arises out of democracy and the most aggravated form of tyranny and slavery out of the most extreme form of liberty
as we might expect
that however was not as i believe your question you rather desired to know what is that disorder which is generated alike in oligarchy and democracy and is the ruin of both
just so he replied
well i said i meant to refer to the class of idle spendthrifts of whom the more courageous are the leaders and the more timid the followers the same whom we were comparing to drones some stingless and others having stings
a very just comparison
these two classes are the plagues of every city in which they are generated being what phlegm and bile are to the body
and the good physician and lawgiver of the state ought like the wise bee master to keep them at a distance and prevent if possible their ever coming in and if they have anyhow found a way in then he should have them and their cells cut out as speedily as possible
yes by all means he said
then in order that we may see clearly what we are doing let us imagine democracy to be divided as indeed it is into three classes for in the first place freedom creates rather more drones in the democratic than there were in the oligarchical state
that is true
and in the democracy they are certainly more intensified
how so
because in the oligarchical state they are disqualified and driven from office and therefore they cannot train or gather strength whereas in a democracy they are almost the entire ruling power and while the keener sort speak and act the rest keep buzzing about the bema and do not suffer a word to be said on the other side hence in democracies almost everything is managed by the drones
very true he said
then there is another class which is always being severed from the mass
what is that
they are the orderly class which in a nation of traders is sure to be the richest
naturally so
they are the most squeezable persons and yield the largest amount of honey to the drones
why he said there is little to be squeezed out of people who have little
and this is called the wealthy class and the drones feed upon them
that is pretty much the case he said
the people are a third class consisting of those who work with their own hands they are not politicians and have not much to live upon
this when assembled is the largest and most powerful class in a democracy
true he said but then the multitude is seldom willing to congregate unless they get a little honey
and do they not share
i said
do not their leaders deprive the rich of their estates and distribute them among the people at the same time taking care to reserve the larger part for themselves
why yes he said to that extent the people do share
and the persons whose property is taken from them are compelled to defend themselves before the people as they best can
what else can they do
and then although they may have no desire of change the others charge them with plotting against the people and being friends of oligarchy
true
and the end is that when they see the people not of their own accord but through ignorance and because they are deceived by informers seeking to do them wrong then at last they are forced to become oligarchs in reality they do not wish to be but the sting of the drones torments them and breeds revolution in them
that is exactly the truth
then come impeachments and judgments and trials of one another
true
the people have always some champion whom they set over them and nurse into greatness
yes that is their way
this and no other is the root from which a tyrant springs when he first appears above ground he is a protector
yes that is quite clear
how then does a protector begin to change into a tyrant
clearly when he does what the man is said to do in the tale of the arcadian temple of lycaean zeus
what tale
the tale is that he who has tasted the entrails of a single human victim minced up with the entrails of other victims is destined to become a wolf
did you never hear it
oh yes
and the protector of the people is like him having a mob entirely at his disposal he is not restrained from shedding the blood of kinsmen by the favourite method of false accusation he brings them into court and murders them making the life of man to disappear and with unholy tongue and lips tasting the blood of his fellow citizens some he kills and others he banishes at the same time hinting at the abolition of debts and partition of lands and after this what will be his destiny
must he not either perish at the hands of his enemies or from being a man become a wolf that is a tyrant
inevitably
this i said is he who begins to make a party against the rich
the same
after a while he is driven out but comes back in spite of his enemies a tyrant full grown
that is clear
and if they are unable to expel him or to get him condemned to death by a public accusation they conspire to assassinate him
yes he said that is their usual way
then comes the famous request for a body guard which is the device of all those who have got thus far in their tyrannical career let not the people s friend as they say be lost to them
exactly
the people readily assent all their fears are for him they have none for themselves
very true
and when a man who is wealthy and is also accused of being an enemy of the people sees this then my friend as the oracle said to croesus by pebbly hermus shore he flees and rests not and is not ashamed to be a coward
and quite right too said he for if he were he would never be ashamed again
but if he is caught he dies
of course
and he the protector of whom we spoke is to be seen not larding the plain with his bulk but himself the overthrower of many standing up in the chariot of state with the reins in his hand no longer protector but tyrant absolute
no doubt he said
and now let us consider the happiness of the man and also of the state in which a creature like him is generated
yes he said let us consider that
at first in the early days of his power he is full of smiles and he salutes every one whom he meets he to be called a tyrant who is making promises in public and also in private
liberating debtors and distributing land to the people and his followers and wanting to be so kind and good to every one
of course he said
but when he has disposed of foreign enemies by conquest or treaty and there is nothing to fear from them then he is always stirring up some war or other in order that the people may require a leader
to be sure
has he not also another object which is that they may be impoverished by payment of taxes and thus compelled to devote themselves to their daily wants and therefore less likely to conspire against him
clearly
and if any of them are suspected by him of having notions of freedom and of resistance to his authority he will have a good pretext for destroying them by placing them at the mercy of the enemy and for all these reasons the tyrant must be always getting up a war
he must
now he begins to grow unpopular
a necessary result
then some of those who joined in setting him up and who are in power speak their minds to him and to one another and the more courageous of them cast in his teeth what is being done
yes that may be expected
and the tyrant if he means to rule must get rid of them he cannot stop while he has a friend or an enemy who is good for anything
he cannot
and therefore he must look about him and see who is valiant who is high minded who is wise who is wealthy happy man he is the enemy of them all and must seek occasion against them whether he will or no until he has made a purgation of the state
yes he said and a rare purgation
yes i said not the sort of purgation which the physicians make of the body for they take away the worse and leave the better part but he does the reverse
if he is to rule i suppose that he cannot help himself
what a blessed alternative i said to be compelled to dwell only with the many bad and to be by them hated or not to live at all
yes that is the alternative
and the more detestable his actions are to the citizens the more satellites and the greater devotion in them will he require
certainly
and who are the devoted band and where will he procure them
they will flock to him he said of their own accord if he pays them
by the dog
i said here are more drones of every sort and from every land
yes he said there are
but will he not desire to get them on the spot
how do you mean
he will rob the citizens of their slaves he will then set them free and enrol them in his body guard
to be sure he said and he will be able to trust them best of all
what a blessed creature i said must this tyrant be he has put to death the others and has these for his trusted friends
yes he said they are quite of his sort
yes i said and these are the new citizens whom he has called into existence who admire him and are his companions while the good hate and avoid him
of course
verily then tragedy is a wise thing and euripides a great tragedian
why so
why because he is the author of the pregnant saying tyrants are wise by living with the wise and he clearly meant to say that they are the wise whom the tyrant makes his companions
yes he said and he also praises tyranny as godlike and many other things of the same kind are said by him and by the other poets
and therefore i said the tragic poets being wise men will forgive us and any others who live after our manner if we do not receive them into our state because they are the eulogists of tyranny
yes he said those who have the wit will doubtless forgive us
but they will continue to go to other cities and attract mobs and hire voices fair and loud and persuasive and draw the cities over to tyrannies and democracies
very true
moreover they are paid for this and receive honour the greatest honour as might be expected from tyrants and the next greatest from democracies but the higher they ascend our constitution hill the more their reputation fails and seems unable from shortness of breath to proceed further
true
but we are wandering from the subject let us therefore return and enquire how the tyrant will maintain that fair and numerous and various and ever changing army of his
if he said there are sacred treasures in the city he will confiscate and spend them and in so far as the fortunes of attainted persons may suffice he will be able to diminish the taxes which he would otherwise have to impose upon the people
and when these fail
why clearly he said then he and his boon companions whether male or female will be maintained out of his father s estate
you mean to say that the people from whom he has derived his being will maintain him and his companions
yes he said they cannot help themselves
but what if the people fly into a passion and aver that a grown up son ought not to be supported by his father but that the father should be supported by the son
the father did not bring him into being or settle him in life in order that when his son became a man he should himself be the servant of his own servants and should support him and his rabble of slaves and companions but that his son should protect him and that by his help he might be emancipated from the government of the rich and aristocratic as they are termed
and so he bids him and his companions depart just as any other father might drive out of the house a riotous son and his undesirable associates
by heaven he said then the parent will discover what a monster he has been fostering in his bosom and when he wants to drive him out he will find that he is weak and his son strong
why you do not mean to say that the tyrant will use violence
what
beat his father if he opposes him
yes he will having first disarmed him
then he is a parricide and a cruel guardian of an aged parent and this is real tyranny about which there can be no longer a mistake as the saying is the people who would escape the smoke which is the slavery of freemen has fallen into the fire which is the tyranny of slaves
thus liberty getting out of all order and reason passes into the harshest and bitterest form of slavery
true he said
very well and may we not rightly say that we have sufficiently discussed the nature of tyranny and the manner of the transition from democracy to tyranny
yes quite enough he said
book ix
last of all comes the tyrannical man about whom we have once more to ask how is he formed out of the democratical
and how does he live in happiness or in misery
yes he said he is the only one remaining
there is however i said a previous question which remains unanswered
what question
i do not think that we have adequately determined the nature and number of the appetites and until this is accomplished the enquiry will always be confused
well he said it is not too late to supply the omission
very true i said and observe the point which i want to understand certain of the unnecessary pleasures and appetites i conceive to be unlawful every one appears to have them but in some persons they are controlled by the laws and by reason and the better desires prevail over them either they are wholly banished or they become few and weak while in the case of others they are stronger and there are more of them
which appetites do you mean
i mean those which are awake when the reasoning and human and ruling power is asleep then the wild beast within us gorged with meat or drink starts up and having shaken off sleep goes forth to satisfy his desires and there is no conceivable folly or crime not excepting incest or any other unnatural union or parricide or the eating of forbidden food which at such a time when he has parted company with all shame and sense a man may not be ready to commit
most true he said
but when a man s pulse is healthy and temperate and when before going to sleep he has awakened his rational powers and fed them on noble thoughts and enquiries collecting himself in meditation after having first indulged his appetites neither too much nor too little but just enough to lay them to sleep and prevent them and their enjoyments and pains from interfering with the higher principle which he leaves in the solitude of pure abstraction free to contemplate and aspire to the knowledge of the unknown whether in past present or future when again he has allayed the passionate element if he has a quarrel against any one i say when after pacifying the two irrational principles he rouses up the third which is reason before he takes his rest then as you know he attains truth most nearly and is least likely to be the sport of fantastic and lawless visions
i quite agree
in saying this i have been running into a digression but the point which i desire to note is that in all of us even in good men there is a lawless wild beast nature which peers out in sleep
pray consider whether i am right and you agree with me
yes i agree
and now remember the character which we attributed to the democratic man
he was supposed from his youth upwards to have been trained under a miserly parent who encouraged the saving appetites in him but discountenanced the unnecessary which aim only at amusement and ornament
true
and then he got into the company of a more refined licentious sort of people and taking to all their wanton ways rushed into the opposite extreme from an abhorrence of his father s meanness
at last being a better man than his corruptors he was drawn in both directions until he halted midway and led a life not of vulgar and slavish passion but of what he deemed moderate indulgence in various pleasures
after this manner the democrat was generated out of the oligarch
yes he said that was our view of him and is so still
and now i said years will have passed away and you must conceive this man such as he is to have a son who is brought up in his father s principles
i can imagine him
then you must further imagine the same thing to happen to the son which has already happened to the father he is drawn into a perfectly lawless life which by his seducers is termed perfect liberty and his father and friends take part with his moderate desires and the opposite party assist the opposite ones
as soon as these dire magicians and tyrant makers find that they are losing their hold on him they contrive to implant in him a master passion to be lord over his idle and spendthrift lusts a sort of monstrous winged drone that is the only image which will adequately describe him
yes he said that is the only adequate image of him
and when his other lusts amid clouds of incense and perfumes and garlands and wines and all the pleasures of a dissolute life now let loose come buzzing around him nourishing to the utmost the sting of desire which they implant in his drone like nature then at last this lord of the soul having madness for the captain of his guard breaks out into a frenzy and if he finds in himself any good opinions or appetites in process of formation and there is in him any sense of shame remaining to these better principles he puts an end and casts them forth until he has purged away temperance and brought in madness to the full
yes he said that is the way in which the tyrannical man is generated
and is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant
i should not wonder
further i said has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant
he has
and you know that a man who is deranged and not right in his mind will fancy that he is able to rule not only over men but also over the gods
that he will
and the tyrannical man in the true sense of the word comes into being when either under the influence of nature or habit or both he becomes drunken lustful passionate
o my friend is not that so
assuredly
such is the man and such is his origin
and next how does he live
suppose as people facetiously say you were to tell me
i imagine i said at the next step in his progress that there will be feasts and carousals and revellings and courtezans and all that sort of thing love is the lord of the house within him and orders all the concerns of his soul
that is certain
yes and every day and every night desires grow up many and formidable and their demands are many
they are indeed he said
his revenues if he has any are soon spent
true
then comes debt and the cutting down of his property
of course
when he has nothing left must not his desires crowding in the nest like young ravens be crying aloud for food and he goaded on by them and especially by love himself who is in a manner the captain of them is in a frenzy and would fain discover whom he can defraud or despoil of his property in order that he may gratify them
yes that is sure to be the case
he must have money no matter how if he is to escape horrid pains and pangs
he must
and as in himself there was a succession of pleasures and the new got the better of the old and took away their rights so he being younger will claim to have more than his father and his mother and if he has spent his own share of the property he will take a slice of theirs
no doubt he will
and if his parents will not give way then he will try first of all to cheat and deceive them
very true
and if he fails then he will use force and plunder them
yes probably
and if the old man and woman fight for their own what then my friend
will the creature feel any compunction at tyrannizing over them
nay he said i should not feel at all comfortable about his parents
but o heavens
adeimantus on account of some new fangled love of a harlot who is anything but a necessary connection can you believe that he would strike the mother who is his ancient friend and necessary to his very existence and would place her under the authority of the other when she is brought under the same roof with her or that under like circumstances he would do the same to his withered old father first and most indispensable of friends for the sake of some newly found blooming youth who is the reverse of indispensable
yes indeed he said i believe that he would
truly then i said a tyrannical son is a blessing to his father and mother
he is indeed he replied
he first takes their property and when that fails and pleasures are beginning to swarm in the hive of his soul then he breaks into a house or steals the garments of some nightly wayfarer next he proceeds to clear a temple
meanwhile the old opinions which he had when a child and which gave judgment about good and evil are overthrown by those others which have just been emancipated and are now the body guard of love and share his empire
these in his democratic days when he was still subject to the laws and to his father were only let loose in the dreams of sleep
but now that he is under the dominion of love he becomes always and in waking reality what he was then very rarely and in a dream only he will commit the foulest murder or eat forbidden food or be guilty of any other horrid act
love is his tyrant and lives lordly in him and lawlessly and being himself a king leads him on as a tyrant leads a state to the performance of any reckless deed by which he can maintain himself and the rabble of his associates whether those whom evil communications have brought in from without or those whom he himself has allowed to break loose within him by reason of a similar evil nature in himself
have we not here a picture of his way of life
yes indeed he said
and if there are only a few of them in the state and the rest of the people are well disposed they go away and become the body guard or mercenary soldiers of some other tyrant who may probably want them for a war and if there is no war they stay at home and do many little pieces of mischief in the city
what sort of mischief
for example they are the thieves burglars cut purses foot pads robbers of temples man stealers of the community or if they are able to speak they turn informers and bear false witness and take bribes
a small catalogue of evils even if the perpetrators of them are few in number
yes i said but small and great are comparative terms and all these things in the misery and evil which they inflict upon a state do not come within a thousand miles of the tyrant when this noxious class and their followers grow numerous and become conscious of their strength assisted by the infatuation of the people they choose from among themselves the one who has most of the tyrant in his own soul and him they create their tyrant
yes he said and he will be the most fit to be a tyrant
if the people yield well and good but if they resist him as he began by beating his own father and mother so now if he has the power he beats them and will keep his dear old fatherland or motherland as the cretans say in subjection to his young retainers whom he has introduced to be their rulers and masters
this is the end of his passions and desires
exactly
when such men are only private individuals and before they get power this is their character they associate entirely with their own flatterers or ready tools or if they want anything from anybody they in their turn are equally ready to bow down before them they profess every sort of affection for them but when they have gained their point they know them no more
yes truly
they are always either the masters or servants and never the friends of anybody the tyrant never tastes of true freedom or friendship
certainly not
and may we not rightly call such men treacherous
no question
also they are utterly unjust if we were right in our notion of justice
yes he said and we were perfectly right
let us then sum up in a word i said the character of the worst man he is the waking reality of what we dreamed
most true
and this is he who being by nature most of a tyrant bears rule and the longer he lives the more of a tyrant he becomes
that is certain said glaucon taking his turn to answer
and will not he who has been shown to be the wickedest be also the most miserable
and he who has tyrannized longest and most most continually and truly miserable although this may not be the opinion of men in general
yes he said inevitably
and must not the tyrannical man be like the tyrannical state and the democratical man like the democratical state and the same of the others
certainly
and as state is to state in virtue and happiness so is man in relation to man
to be sure
then comparing our original city which was under a king and the city which is under a tyrant how do they stand as to virtue
they are the opposite extremes he said for one is the very best and the other is the very worst
there can be no mistake i said as to which is which and therefore i will at once enquire whether you would arrive at a similar decision about their relative happiness and misery
and here we must not allow ourselves to be panic stricken at the apparition of the tyrant who is only a unit and may perhaps have a few retainers about him but let us go as we ought into every corner of the city and look all about and then we will give our opinion
a fair invitation he replied and i see as every one must that a tyranny is the wretchedest form of government and the rule of a king the happiest
and in estimating the men too may i not fairly make a like request that i should have a judge whose mind can enter into and see through human nature
he must not be like a child who looks at the outside and is dazzled at the pompous aspect which the tyrannical nature assumes to the beholder but let him be one who has a clear insight
may i suppose that the judgment is given in the hearing of us all by one who is able to judge and has dwelt in the same place with him and been present at his dally life and known him in his family relations where he may be seen stripped of his tragedy attire and again in the hour of public danger he shall tell us about the happiness and misery of the tyrant when compared with other men
that again he said is a very fair proposal
shall i assume that we ourselves are able and experienced judges and have before now met with such a person
we shall then have some one who will answer our enquiries
by all means
let me ask you not to forget the parallel of the individual and the state bearing this in mind and glancing in turn from one to the other of them will you tell me their respective conditions
what do you mean
he asked
beginning with the state i replied would you say that a city which is governed by a tyrant is free or enslaved
no city he said can be more completely enslaved
and yet as you see there are freemen as well as masters in such a state
yes he said i see that there are a few but the people speaking generally and the best of them are miserably degraded and enslaved
then if the man is like the state i said must not the same rule prevail
his soul is full of meanness and vulgarity the best elements in him are enslaved and there is a small ruling part which is also the worst and maddest
inevitably
and would you say that the soul of such an one is the soul of a freeman or of a slave
he has the soul of a slave in my opinion
and the state which is enslaved under a tyrant is utterly incapable of acting voluntarily
utterly incapable
and also the soul which is under a tyrant is least capable of doing what she desires there is a gadfly which goads her and she is full of trouble and remorse
certainly
and is the city which is under a tyrant rich or poor
poor
and the tyrannical soul must be always poor and insatiable
true
and must not such a state and such a man be always full of fear
yes indeed
is there any state in which you will find more of lamentation and sorrow and groaning and pain
certainly not
and is there any man in whom you will find more of this sort of misery than in the tyrannical man who is in a fury of passions and desires
impossible
reflecting upon these and similar evils you held the tyrannical state to be the most miserable of states
and i was right he said
certainly i said
and when you see the same evils in the tyrannical man what do you say of him
i say that he is by far the most miserable of all men
there i said i think that you are beginning to go wrong
what do you mean
i do not think that he has as yet reached the utmost extreme of misery
then who is more miserable
one of whom i am about to speak
who is that
he who is of a tyrannical nature and instead of leading a private life has been cursed with the further misfortune of being a public tyrant
from what has been said i gather that you are right
yes i replied but in this high argument you should be a little more certain and should not conjecture only for of all questions this respecting good and evil is the greatest
very true he said
let me then offer you an illustration which may i think throw a light upon this subject
what is your illustration
the case of rich individuals in cities who possess many slaves from them you may form an idea of the tyrant s condition for they both have slaves the only difference is that he has more slaves
yes that is the difference
you know that they live securely and have nothing to apprehend from their servants
what should they fear
nothing
but do you observe the reason of this
yes the reason is that the whole city is leagued together for the protection of each individual
very true i said
but imagine one of these owners the master say of some fifty slaves together with his family and property and slaves carried off by a god into the wilderness where there are no freemen to help him will he not be in an agony of fear lest he and his wife and children should be put to death by his slaves
yes he said he will be in the utmost fear
the time has arrived when he will be compelled to flatter divers of his slaves and make many promises to them of freedom and other things much against his will he will have to cajole his own servants
yes he said that will be the only way of saving himself
and suppose the same god who carried him away to surround him with neighbours who will not suffer one man to be the master of another and who if they could catch the offender would take his life
his case will be still worse if you suppose him to be everywhere surrounded and watched by enemies
and is not this the sort of prison in which the tyrant will be bound he who being by nature such as we have described is full of all sorts of fears and lusts
his soul is dainty and greedy and yet alone of all men in the city he is never allowed to go on a journey or to see the things which other freemen desire to see but he lives in his hole like a woman hidden in the house and is jealous of any other citizen who goes into foreign parts and sees anything of interest
very true he said
and amid evils such as these will not he who is ill governed in his own person the tyrannical man i mean whom you just now decided to be the most miserable of all will not he be yet more miserable when instead of leading a private life he is constrained by fortune to be a public tyrant
he has to be master of others when he is not master of himself he is like a diseased or paralytic man who is compelled to pass his life not in retirement but fighting and combating with other men
yes he said the similitude is most exact
is not his case utterly miserable
and does not the actual tyrant lead a worse life than he whose life you determined to be the worst
certainly
he who is the real tyrant whatever men may think is the real slave and is obliged to practise the greatest adulation and servility and to be the flatterer of the vilest of mankind
he has desires which he is utterly unable to satisfy and has more wants than any one and is truly poor if you know how to inspect the whole soul of him all his life long he is beset with fear and is full of convulsions and distractions even as the state which he resembles and surely the resemblance holds
very true he said
moreover as we were saying before he grows worse from having power he becomes and is of necessity more jealous more faithless more unjust more friendless more impious than he was at first he is the purveyor and cherisher of every sort of vice and the consequence is that he is supremely miserable and that he makes everybody else as miserable as himself
no man of any sense will dispute your words
come then i said and as the general umpire in theatrical contests proclaims the result do you also decide who in your opinion is first in the scale of happiness and who second and in what order the others follow there are five of them in all they are the royal timocratical oligarchical democratical tyrannical
the decision will be easily given he replied they shall be choruses coming on the stage and i must judge them in the order in which they enter by the criterion of virtue and vice happiness and misery
need we hire a herald or shall i announce that the son of ariston has decided that the best and justest is also the happiest and that this is he who is the most royal man and king over himself and that the worst and most unjust man is also the most miserable and that this is he who being the greatest tyrant of himself is also the greatest tyrant of his state
make the proclamation yourself he said
and shall i add whether seen or unseen by gods and men 
let the words be added
then this i said will be our first proof and there is another which may also have some weight
what is that
the second proof is derived from the nature of the soul seeing that the individual soul like the state has been divided by us into three principles the division may i think furnish a new demonstration
of what nature
it seems to me that to these three principles three pleasures correspond also three desires and governing powers
how do you mean
he said
there is one principle with which as we were saying a man learns another with which he is angry the third having many forms has no special name but is denoted by the general term appetitive from the extraordinary strength and vehemence of the desires of eating and drinking and the other sensual appetites which are the main elements of it also money loving because such desires are generally satisfied by the help of money
that is true he said
if we were to say that the loves and pleasures of this third part were concerned with gain we should then be able to fall back on a single notion and might truly and intelligibly describe this part of the soul as loving gain or money
i agree with you
again is not the passionate element wholly set on ruling and conquering and getting fame
true
suppose we call it the contentious or ambitious would the term be suitable
extremely suitable
on the other hand every one sees that the principle of knowledge is wholly directed to the truth and cares less than either of the others for gain or fame
far less
lover of wisdom lover of knowledge are titles which we may fitly apply to that part of the soul
certainly
one principle prevails in the souls of one class of men another in others as may happen
yes
then we may begin by assuming that there are three classes of men lovers of wisdom lovers of honour lovers of gain
exactly
and there are three kinds of pleasure which are their several objects
very true
now if you examine the three classes of men and ask of them in turn which of their lives is pleasantest each will be found praising his own and depreciating that of others the money maker will contrast the vanity of honour or of learning if they bring no money with the solid advantages of gold and silver
true he said
and the lover of honour what will be his opinion
will he not think that the pleasure of riches is vulgar while the pleasure of learning if it brings no distinction is all smoke and nonsense to him
very true
and are we to suppose i said that the philosopher sets any value on other pleasures in comparison with the pleasure of knowing the truth and in that pursuit abiding ever learning not so far indeed from the heaven of pleasure
does he not call the other pleasures necessary under the idea that if there were no necessity for them he would rather not have them
there can be no doubt of that he replied
since then the pleasures of each class and the life of each are in dispute and the question is not which life is more or less honourable or better or worse but which is the more pleasant or painless how shall we know who speaks truly
i cannot myself tell he said
well but what ought to be the criterion
is any better than experience and wisdom and reason
there cannot be a better he said
then i said reflect
of the three individuals which has the greatest experience of all the pleasures which we enumerated
has the lover of gain in learning the nature of essential truth greater experience of the pleasure of knowledge than the philosopher has of the pleasure of gain
the philosopher he replied has greatly the advantage for he has of necessity always known the taste of the other pleasures from his childhood upwards but the lover of gain in all his experience has not of necessity tasted or i should rather say even had he desired could hardly have tasted the sweetness of learning and knowing truth
then the lover of wisdom has a great advantage over the lover of gain for he has a double experience
yes very great
again has he greater experience of the pleasures of honour or the lover of honour of the pleasures of wisdom
nay he said all three are honoured in proportion as they attain their object for the rich man and the brave man and the wise man alike have their crowd of admirers and as they all receive honour they all have experience of the pleasures of honour but the delight which is to be found in the knowledge of true being is known to the philosopher only
his experience then will enable him to judge better than any one
far better
and he is the only one who has wisdom as well as experience
certainly
further the very faculty which is the instrument of judgment is not possessed by the covetous or ambitious man but only by the philosopher
what faculty
reason with whom as we were saying the decision ought to rest
yes
and reasoning is peculiarly his instrument
certainly
if wealth and gain were the criterion then the praise or blame of the lover of gain would surely be the most trustworthy
assuredly
or if honour or victory or courage in that case the judgment of the ambitious or pugnacious would be the truest
clearly
but since experience and wisdom and reason are the judges the only inference possible he replied is that pleasures which are approved by the lover of wisdom and reason are the truest
and so we arrive at the result that the pleasure of the intelligent part of the soul is the pleasantest of the three and that he of us in whom this is the ruling principle has the pleasantest life
unquestionably he said the wise man speaks with authority when he approves of his own life
and what does the judge affirm to be the life which is next and the pleasure which is next
clearly that of the soldier and lover of honour who is nearer to himself than the money maker
last comes the lover of gain
very true he said
twice in succession then has the just man overthrown the unjust in this conflict and now comes the third trial which is dedicated to olympian zeus the saviour a sage whispers in my ear that no pleasure except that of the wise is quite true and pure all others are a shadow only and surely this will prove the greatest and most decisive of falls
yes the greatest but will you explain yourself
i will work out the subject and you shall answer my questions
proceed
say then is not pleasure opposed to pain
true
and there is a neutral state which is neither pleasure nor pain
there is
a state which is intermediate and a sort of repose of the soul about either that is what you mean
yes
you remember what people say when they are sick
what do they say
that after all nothing is pleasanter than health
but then they never knew this to be the greatest of pleasures until they were ill
yes i know he said
and when persons are suffering from acute pain you must have heard them say that there is nothing pleasanter than to get rid of their pain
i have
and there are many other cases of suffering in which the mere rest and cessation of pain and not any positive enjoyment is extolled by them as the greatest pleasure
yes he said at the time they are pleased and well content to be at rest
again when pleasure ceases that sort of rest or cessation will be painful
doubtless he said
then the intermediate state of rest will be pleasure and will also be pain
so it would seem
but can that which is neither become both
i should say not
and both pleasure and pain are motions of the soul are they not
yes
but that which is neither was just now shown to be rest and not motion and in a mean between them
yes
how then can we be right in supposing that the absence of pain is pleasure or that the absence of pleasure is pain
impossible
this then is an appearance only and not a reality that is to say the rest is pleasure at the moment and in comparison of what is painful and painful in comparison of what is pleasant but all these representations when tried by the test of true pleasure are not real but a sort of imposition
that is the inference
look at the other class of pleasures which have no antecedent pains and you will no longer suppose as you perhaps may at present that pleasure is only the cessation of pain or pain of pleasure
what are they he said and where shall i find them
there are many of them take as an example the pleasures of smell which are very great and have no antecedent pains they come in a moment and when they depart leave no pain behind them
most true he said
let us not then be induced to believe that pure pleasure is the cessation of pain or pain of pleasure
no
still the more numerous and violent pleasures which reach the soul through the body are generally of this sort they are reliefs of pain
that is true
and the anticipations of future pleasures and pains are of a like nature
yes
shall i give you an illustration of them
let me hear
you would allow i said that there is in nature an upper and lower and middle region
i should
and if a person were to go from the lower to the middle region would he not imagine that he is going up and he who is standing in the middle and sees whence he has come would imagine that he is already in the upper region if he has never seen the true upper world
to be sure he said how can he think otherwise
but if he were taken back again he would imagine and truly imagine that he was descending
no doubt
all that would arise out of his ignorance of the true upper and middle and lower regions
yes
then can you wonder that persons who are inexperienced in the truth as they have wrong ideas about many other things should also have wrong ideas about pleasure and pain and the intermediate state so that when they are only being drawn towards the painful they feel pain and think the pain which they experience to be real and in like manner when drawn away from pain to the neutral or intermediate state they firmly believe that they have reached the goal of satiety and pleasure they not knowing pleasure err in contrasting pain with the absence of pain which is like contrasting black with grey instead of white can you wonder i say at this
no indeed i should be much more disposed to wonder at the opposite
look at the matter thus hunger thirst and the like are inanitions of the bodily state
yes
and ignorance and folly are inanitions of the soul
true
and food and wisdom are the corresponding satisfactions of either
certainly
and is the satisfaction derived from that which has less or from that which has more existence the truer
clearly from that which has more
what classes of things have a greater share of pure existence in your judgment those of which food and drink and condiments and all kinds of sustenance are examples or the class which contains true opinion and knowledge and mind and all the different kinds of virtue
put the question in this way which has a more pure being that which is concerned with the invariable the immortal and the true and is of such a nature and is found in such natures or that which is concerned with and found in the variable and mortal and is itself variable and mortal
far purer he replied is the being of that which is concerned with the invariable
and does the essence of the invariable partake of knowledge in the same degree as of essence
yes of knowledge in the same degree
and of truth in the same degree
yes
and conversely that which has less of truth will also have less of essence
necessarily
then in general those kinds of things which are in the service of the body have less of truth and essence than those which are in the service of the soul
far less
and has not the body itself less of truth and essence than the soul
yes
what is filled with more real existence and actually has a more real existence is more really filled than that which is filled with less real existence and is less real
of course
and if there be a pleasure in being filled with that which is according to nature that which is more really filled with more real being will more really and truly enjoy true pleasure whereas that which participates in less real being will be less truly and surely satisfied and will participate in an illusory and less real pleasure
unquestionably
those then who know not wisdom and virtue and are always busy with gluttony and sensuality go down and up again as far as the mean and in this region they move at random throughout life but they never pass into the true upper world thither they neither look nor do they ever find their way neither are they truly filled with true being nor do they taste of pure and abiding pleasure
like cattle with their eyes always looking down and their heads stooping to the earth that is to the dining table they fatten and feed and breed and in their excessive love of these delights they kick and butt at one another with horns and hoofs which are made of iron and they kill one another by reason of their insatiable lust
for they fill themselves with that which is not substantial and the part of themselves which they fill is also unsubstantial and incontinent
verily socrates said glaucon you describe the life of the many like an oracle
their pleasures are mixed with pains how can they be otherwise
for they are mere shadows and pictures of the true and are coloured by contrast which exaggerates both light and shade and so they implant in the minds of fools insane desires of themselves and they are fought about as stesichorus says that the greeks fought about the shadow of helen at troy in ignorance of the truth
something of that sort must inevitably happen
and must not the like happen with the spirited or passionate element of the soul
will not the passionate man who carries his passion into action be in the like case whether he is envious and ambitious or violent and contentious or angry and discontented if he be seeking to attain honour and victory and the satisfaction of his anger without reason or sense
yes he said the same will happen with the spirited element also
then may we not confidently assert that the lovers of money and honour when they seek their pleasures under the guidance and in the company of reason and knowledge and pursue after and win the pleasures which wisdom shows them will also have the truest pleasures in the highest degree which is attainable to them inasmuch as they follow truth and they will have the pleasures which are natural to them if that which is best for each one is also most natural to him
yes certainly the best is the most natural
and when the whole soul follows the philosophical principle and there is no division the several parts are just and do each of them their own business and enjoy severally the best and truest pleasures of which they are capable
exactly
but when either of the two other principles prevails it fails in attaining its own pleasure and compels the rest to pursue after a pleasure which is a shadow only and which is not their own
true
and the greater the interval which separates them from philosophy and reason the more strange and illusive will be the pleasure
yes
and is not that farthest from reason which is at the greatest distance from law and order
clearly
and the lustful and tyrannical desires are as we saw at the greatest distance
yes
and the royal and orderly desires are nearest
yes
then the tyrant will live at the greatest distance from true or natural pleasure and the king at the least
certainly
but if so the tyrant will live most unpleasantly and the king most pleasantly
inevitably
would you know the measure of the interval which separates them
will you tell me
there appear to be three pleasures one genuine and two spurious now the transgression of the tyrant reaches a point beyond the spurious he has run away from the region of law and reason and taken up his abode with certain slave pleasures which are his satellites and the measure of his inferiority can only be expressed in a figure
how do you mean
i assume i said that the tyrant is in the third place from the oligarch the democrat was in the middle
yes
and if there is truth in what has preceded he will be wedded to an image of pleasure which is thrice removed as to truth from the pleasure of the oligarch
he will
and the oligarch is third from the royal since we count as one royal and aristocratical
yes he is third
then the tyrant is removed from true pleasure by the space of a number which is three times three
manifestly
the shadow then of tyrannical pleasure determined by the number of length will be a plane figure
certainly
and if you raise the power and make the plane a solid there is no difficulty in seeing how vast is the interval by which the tyrant is parted from the king
yes the arithmetician will easily do the sum
or if some person begins at the other end and measures the interval by which the king is parted from the tyrant in truth of pleasure he will find him when the multiplication is completed living 729 times more pleasantly and the tyrant more painfully by this same interval
what a wonderful calculation
and how enormous is the distance which separates the just from the unjust in regard to pleasure and pain
yet a true calculation i said and a number which nearly concerns human life if human beings are concerned with days and nights and months and years
yes he said human life is certainly concerned with them
then if the good and just man be thus superior in pleasure to the evil and unjust his superiority will be infinitely greater in propriety of life and in beauty and virtue
immeasurably greater
well i said and now having arrived at this stage of the argument we may revert to the words which brought us hither was not some one saying that injustice was a gain to the perfectly unjust who was reputed to be just
yes that was said
now then having determined the power and quality of justice and injustice let us have a little conversation with him
what shall we say to him
let us make an image of the soul that he may have his own words presented before his eyes
of what sort
an ideal image of the soul like the composite creations of ancient mythology such as the chimera or scylla or cerberus and there are many others in which two or more different natures are said to grow into one
there are said of have been such unions
then do you now model the form of a multitudinous many headed monster having a ring of heads of all manner of beasts tame and wild which he is able to generate and metamorphose at will
you suppose marvellous powers in the artist but as language is more pliable than wax or any similar substance let there be such a model as you propose
suppose now that you make a second form as of a lion and a third of a man the second smaller than the first and the third smaller than the second
that he said is an easier task and i have made them as you say
and now join them and let the three grow into one
that has been accomplished
next fashion the outside of them into a single image as of a man so that he who is not able to look within and sees only the outer hull may believe the beast to be a single human creature
i have done so he said
and now to him who maintains that it is profitable for the human creature to be unjust and unprofitable to be just let us reply that if he be right it is profitable for this creature to feast the multitudinous monster and strengthen the lion and the lion like qualities but to starve and weaken the man who is consequently liable to be dragged about at the mercy of either of the other two and he is not to attempt to familiarize or harmonize them with one another he ought rather to suffer them to fight and bite and devour one another
certainly he said that is what the approver of injustice says
to him the supporter of justice makes answer that he should ever so speak and act as to give the man within him in some way or other the most complete mastery over the entire human creature
he should watch over the many headed monster like a good husbandman fostering and cultivating the gentle qualities and preventing the wild ones from growing he should be making the lion heart his ally and in common care of them all should be uniting the several parts with one another and with himself
yes he said that is quite what the maintainer of justice say
and so from every point of view whether of pleasure honour or advantage the approver of justice is right and speaks the truth and the disapprover is wrong and false and ignorant
yes from every point of view
come now and let us gently reason with the unjust who is not intentionally in error
sweet sir we will say to him what think you of things esteemed noble and ignoble
is not the noble that which subjects the beast to the man or rather to the god in man and the ignoble that which subjects the man to the beast
he can hardly avoid saying yes can he now
not if he has any regard for my opinion
but if he agree so far we may ask him to answer another question then how would a man profit if he received gold and silver on the condition that he was to enslave the noblest part of him to the worst
who can imagine that a man who sold his son or daughter into slavery for money especially if he sold them into the hands of fierce and evil men would be the gainer however large might be the sum which he received
and will any one say that he is not a miserable caitiff who remorselessly sells his own divine being to that which is most godless and detestable
eriphyle took the necklace as the price of her husband s life but he is taking a bribe in order to compass a worse ruin
yes said glaucon far worse i will answer for him
has not the intemperate been censured of old because in him the huge multiform monster is allowed to be too much at large
clearly
and men are blamed for pride and bad temper when the lion and serpent element in them disproportionately grows and gains strength
yes
and luxury and softness are blamed because they relax and weaken this same creature and make a coward of him
very true
and is not a man reproached for flattery and meanness who subordinates the spirited animal to the unruly monster and for the sake of money of which he can never have enough habituates him in the days of his youth to be trampled in the mire and from being a lion to become a monkey
true he said
and why are mean employments and manual arts a reproach
only because they imply a natural weakness of the higher principle the individual is unable to control the creatures within him but has to court them and his great study is how to flatter them
such appears to be the reason
and therefore being desirous of placing him under a rule like that of the best we say that he ought to be the servant of the best in whom the divine rules not as thrasymachus supposed to the injury of the servant but because every one had better be ruled by divine wisdom dwelling within him or if this be impossible then by an external authority in order that we may be all as far as possible under the same government friends and equals
true he said
and this is clearly seen to be the intention of the law which is the ally of the whole city and is seen also in the authority which we exercise over children and the refusal to let them be free until we have established in them a principle analogous to the constitution of a state and by cultivation of this higher element have set up in their hearts a guardian and ruler like our own and when this is done they may go their ways
yes he said the purpose of the law is manifest
from what point of view then and on what ground can we say that a man is profited by injustice or intemperance or other baseness which will make him a worse man even though he acquire money or power by his wickedness
from no point of view at all
what shall he profit if his injustice be undetected and unpunished
he who is undetected only gets worse whereas he who is detected and punished has the brutal part of his nature silenced and humanized the gentler element in him is liberated and his whole soul is perfected and ennobled by the acquirement of justice and temperance and wisdom more than the body ever is by receiving gifts of beauty strength and health in proportion as the soul is more honourable than the body
certainly he said
to this nobler purpose the man of understanding will devote the energies of his life
and in the first place he will honour studies which impress these qualities on his soul and will disregard others
clearly he said
in the next place he will regulate his bodily habit and training and so far will he be from yielding to brutal and irrational pleasures that he will regard even health as quite a secondary matter his first object will be not that he may be fair or strong or well unless he is likely thereby to gain temperance but he will always desire so to attemper the body as to preserve the harmony of the soul
certainly he will if he has true music in him
and in the acquisition of wealth there is a principle of order and harmony which he will also observe he will not allow himself to be dazzled by the foolish applause of the world and heap up riches to his own infinite harm
certainly not he said
he will look at the city which is within him and take heed that no disorder occur in it such as might arise either from superfluity or from want and upon this principle he will regulate his property and gain or spend according to his means
very true
and for the same reason he will gladly accept and enjoy such honours as he deems likely to make him a better man but those whether private or public which are likely to disorder his life he will avoid
then if that is his motive he will not be a statesman
by the dog of egypt he will
in the city which is his own he certainly will though in the land of his birth perhaps not unless he have a divine call
i understand you mean that he will be a ruler in the city of which we are the founders and which exists in idea only for i do not believe that there is such an one anywhere on earth
in heaven i replied there is laid up a pattern of it methinks which he who desires may behold and beholding may set his own house in order
but whether such an one exists or ever will exist in fact is no matter for he will live after the manner of that city having nothing to do with any other
i think so he said
book x
of the many excellences which i perceive in the order of our state there is none which upon reflection pleases me better than the rule about poetry
to what do you refer
to the rejection of imitative poetry which certainly ought not to be received as i see far more clearly now that the parts of the soul have been distinguished
what do you mean
speaking in confidence for i should not like to have my words repeated to the tragedians and the rest of the imitative tribe but i do not mind saying to you that all poetical imitations are ruinous to the understanding of the hearers and that the knowledge of their true nature is the only antidote to them
explain the purport of your remark
well i will tell you although i have always from my earliest youth had an awe and love of homer which even now makes the words falter on my lips for he is the great captain and teacher of the whole of that charming tragic company but a man is not to be reverenced more than the truth and therefore i will speak out
very good he said
listen to me then or rather answer me
put your question
can you tell me what imitation is
for i really do not know
a likely thing then that i should know
why not
for the duller eye may often see a thing sooner than the keener
very true he said but in your presence even if i had any faint notion i could not muster courage to utter it
will you enquire yourself
well then shall we begin the enquiry in our usual manner whenever a number of individuals have a common name we assume them to have also a corresponding idea or form do you understand me
i do
let us take any common instance there are beds and tables in the world plenty of them are there not
yes
but there are only two ideas or forms of them one the idea of a bed the other of a table
true
and the maker of either of them makes a bed or he makes a table for our use in accordance with the idea that is our way of speaking in this and similar instances but no artificer makes the ideas themselves how could he
impossible
and there is another artist i should like to know what you would say of him
who is he
one who is the maker of all the works of all other workmen
what an extraordinary man
wait a little and there will be more reason for your saying so
for this is he who is able to make not only vessels of every kind but plants and animals himself and all other things the earth and heaven and the things which are in heaven or under the earth he makes the gods also
he must be a wizard and no mistake
oh
you are incredulous are you
do you mean that there is no such maker or creator or that in one sense there might be a maker of all these things but in another not
do you see that there is a way in which you could make them all yourself
what way
an easy way enough or rather there are many ways in which the feat might be quickly and easily accomplished none quicker than that of turning a mirror round and round you would soon enough make the sun and the heavens and the earth and yourself and other animals and plants and all the other things of which we were just now speaking in the mirror
yes he said but they would be appearances only
very good i said you are coming to the point now
and the painter too is as i conceive just such another a creator of appearances is he not
of course
but then i suppose you will say that what he creates is untrue
and yet there is a sense in which the painter also creates a bed
yes he said but not a real bed
and what of the maker of the bed
were you not saying that he too makes not the idea which according to our view is the essence of the bed but only a particular bed
yes i did
then if he does not make that which exists he cannot make true existence but only some semblance of existence and if any one were to say that the work of the maker of the bed or of any other workman has real existence he could hardly be supposed to be speaking the truth
at any rate he replied philosophers would say that he was not speaking the truth
no wonder then that his work too is an indistinct expression of truth
no wonder
suppose now that by the light of the examples just offered we enquire who this imitator is
if you please
well then here are three beds one existing in nature which is made by god as i think that we may say for no one else can be the maker
no
there is another which is the work of the carpenter
yes
and the work of the painter is a third
yes
beds then are of three kinds and there are three artists who superintend them god the maker of the bed and the painter
yes there are three of them
god whether from choice or from necessity made one bed in nature and one only two or more such ideal beds neither ever have been nor ever will be made by god
why is that
because even if he had made but two a third would still appear behind them which both of them would have for their idea and that would be the ideal bed and not the two others
very true he said
god knew this and he desired to be the real maker of a real bed not a particular maker of a particular bed and therefore he created a bed which is essentially and by nature one only
so we believe
shall we then speak of him as the natural author or maker of the bed
yes he replied inasmuch as by the natural process of creation he is the author of this and of all other things
and what shall we say of the carpenter is not he also the maker of the bed
yes
but would you call the painter a creator and maker
certainly not
yet if he is not the maker what is he in relation to the bed
i think he said that we may fairly designate him as the imitator of that which the others make
good i said then you call him who is third in the descent from nature an imitator
certainly he said
and the tragic poet is an imitator and therefore like all other imitators he is thrice removed from the king and from the truth
that appears to be so
then about the imitator we are agreed
and what about the painter
i would like to know whether he may be thought to imitate that which originally exists in nature or only the creations of artists
the latter
as they are or as they appear
you have still to determine this
what do you mean
i mean that you may look at a bed from different points of view obliquely or directly or from any other point of view and the bed will appear different but there is no difference in reality
and the same of all things
yes he said the difference is only apparent
now let me ask you another question which is the art of painting designed to be an imitation of things as they are or as they appear of appearance or of reality
of appearance
then the imitator i said is a long way off the truth and can do all things because he lightly touches on a small part of them and that part an image
for example a painter will paint a cobbler carpenter or any other artist though he knows nothing of their arts and if he is a good artist he may deceive children or simple persons when he shows them his picture of a carpenter from a distance and they will fancy that they are looking at a real carpenter
certainly
and whenever any one informs us that he has found a man who knows all the arts and all things else that anybody knows and every single thing with a higher degree of accuracy than any other man whoever tells us this i think that we can only imagine him to be a simple creature who is likely to have been deceived by some wizard or actor whom he met and whom he thought all knowing because he himself was unable to analyse the nature of knowledge and ignorance and imitation
most true
and so when we hear persons saying that the tragedians and homer who is at their head know all the arts and all things human virtue as well as vice and divine things too for that the good poet cannot compose well unless he knows his subject and that he who has not this knowledge can never be a poet we ought to consider whether here also there may not be a similar illusion
perhaps they may have come across imitators and been deceived by them they may not have remembered when they saw their works that these were but imitations thrice removed from the truth and could easily be made without any knowledge of the truth because they are appearances only and not realities
or after all they may be in the right and poets do really know the things about which they seem to the many to speak so well
the question he said should by all means be considered
now do you suppose that if a person were able to make the original as well as the image he would seriously devote himself to the image making branch
would he allow imitation to be the ruling principle of his life as if he had nothing higher in him
i should say not
the real artist who knew what he was imitating would be interested in realities and not in imitations and would desire to leave as memorials of himself works many and fair and instead of being the author of encomiums he would prefer to be the theme of them
yes he said that would be to him a source of much greater honour and profit
then i said we must put a question to homer not about medicine or any of the arts to which his poems only incidentally refer we are not going to ask him or any other poet whether he has cured patients like asclepius or left behind him a school of medicine such as the asclepiads were or whether he only talks about medicine and other arts at second hand but we have a right to know respecting military tactics politics education which are the chiefest and noblest subjects of his poems and we may fairly ask him about them
friend homer then we say to him if you are only in the second remove from truth in what you say of virtue and not in the third not an image maker or imitator and if you are able to discern what pursuits make men better or worse in private or public life tell us what state was ever better governed by your help
the good order of lacedaemon is due to lycurgus and many other cities great and small have been similarly benefited by others but who says that you have been a good legislator to them and have done them any good
italy and sicily boast of charondas and there is solon who is renowned among us but what city has anything to say about you
is there any city which he might name
i think not said glaucon not even the homerids themselves pretend that he was a legislator
well but is there any war on record which was carried on successfully by him or aided by his counsels when he was alive
there is not
or is there any invention of his applicable to the arts or to human life such as thales the milesian or anacharsis the scythian and other ingenious men have conceived which is attributed to him
there is absolutely nothing of the kind
but if homer never did any public service was he privately a guide or teacher of any
had he in his lifetime friends who loved to associate with him and who handed down to posterity an homeric way of life such as was established by pythagoras who was so greatly beloved for his wisdom and whose followers are to this day quite celebrated for the order which was named after him
nothing of the kind is recorded of him
for surely socrates creophylus the companion of homer that child of flesh whose name always makes us laugh might be more justly ridiculed for his stupidity if as is said homer was greatly neglected by him and others in his own day when he was alive
yes i replied that is the tradition
but can you imagine glaucon that if homer had really been able to educate and improve mankind if he had possessed knowledge and not been a mere imitator can you imagine i say that he would not have had many followers and been honoured and loved by them
protagoras of abdera and prodicus of ceos and a host of others have only to whisper to their contemporaries you will never be able to manage either your own house or your own state until you appoint us to be your ministers of education and this ingenious device of theirs has such an effect in making men love them that their companions all but carry them about on their shoulders
and is it conceivable that the contemporaries of homer or again of hesiod would have allowed either of them to go about as rhapsodists if they had really been able to make mankind virtuous
would they not have been as unwilling to part with them as with gold and have compelled them to stay at home with them
or if the master would not stay then the disciples would have followed him about everywhere until they had got education enough
yes socrates that i think is quite true
then must we not infer that all these poetical individuals beginning with homer are only imitators they copy images of virtue and the like but the truth they never reach
the poet is like a painter who as we have already observed will make a likeness of a cobbler though he understands nothing of cobbling and his picture is good enough for those who know no more than he does and judge only by colours and figures
quite so
in like manner the poet with his words and phrases may be said to lay on the colours of the several arts himself understanding their nature only enough to imitate them and other people who are as ignorant as he is and judge only from his words imagine that if he speaks of cobbling or of military tactics or of anything else in metre and harmony and rhythm he speaks very well such is the sweet influence which melody and rhythm by nature have
and i think that you must have observed again and again what a poor appearance the tales of poets make when stripped of the colours which music puts upon them and recited in simple prose
yes he said
they are like faces which were never really beautiful but only blooming and now the bloom of youth has passed away from them
exactly
here is another point the imitator or maker of the image knows nothing of true existence he knows appearances only
am i not right
yes
then let us have a clear understanding and not be satisfied with half an explanation
proceed
of the painter we say that he will paint reins and he will paint a bit
yes
and the worker in leather and brass will make them
certainly
but does the painter know the right form of the bit and reins
nay hardly even the workers in brass and leather who make them only the horseman who knows how to use them he knows their right form
most true
and may we not say the same of all things
what
that there are three arts which are concerned with all things one which uses another which makes a third which imitates them
yes
and the excellence or beauty or truth of every structure animate or inanimate and of every action of man is relative to the use for which nature or the artist has intended them
true
then the user of them must have the greatest experience of them and he must indicate to the maker the good or bad qualities which develop themselves in use for example the flute player will tell the flute maker which of his flutes is satisfactory to the performer he will tell him how he ought to make them and the other will attend to his instructions
of course
the one knows and therefore speaks with authority about the goodness and badness of flutes while the other confiding in him will do what he is told by him
true
the instrument is the same but about the excellence or badness of it the maker will only attain to a correct belief and this he will gain from him who knows by talking to him and being compelled to hear what he has to say whereas the user will have knowledge
true
but will the imitator have either
will he know from use whether or no his drawing is correct or beautiful
or will he have right opinion from being compelled to associate with another who knows and gives him instructions about what he should draw
neither
then he will no more have true opinion than he will have knowledge about the goodness or badness of his imitations
i suppose not
the imitative artist will be in a brilliant state of intelligence about his own creations
nay very much the reverse
and still he will go on imitating without knowing what makes a thing good or bad and may be expected therefore to imitate only that which appears to be good to the ignorant multitude
just so
thus far then we are pretty well agreed that the imitator has no knowledge worth mentioning of what he imitates
imitation is only a kind of play or sport and the tragic poets whether they write in iambic or in heroic verse are imitators in the highest degree
very true
and now tell me i conjure you has not imitation been shown by us to be concerned with that which is thrice removed from the truth
certainly
and what is the faculty in man to which imitation is addressed
what do you mean
i will explain the body which is large when seen near appears small when seen at a distance
true
and the same object appears straight when looked at out of the water and crooked when in the water and the concave becomes convex owing to the illusion about colours to which the sight is liable
thus every sort of confusion is revealed within us and this is that weakness of the human mind on which the art of conjuring and of deceiving by light and shadow and other ingenious devices imposes having an effect upon us like magic
true
and the arts of measuring and numbering and weighing come to the rescue of the human understanding there is the beauty of them and the apparent greater or less or more or heavier no longer have the mastery over us but give way before calculation and measure and weight
most true
and this surely must be the work of the calculating and rational principle in the soul
to be sure
and when this principle measures and certifies that some things are equal or that some are greater or less than others there occurs an apparent contradiction
true
but were we not saying that such a contradiction is impossible the same faculty cannot have contrary opinions at the same time about the same thing
very true
then that part of the soul which has an opinion contrary to measure is not the same with that which has an opinion in accordance with measure
true
and the better part of the soul is likely to be that which trusts to measure and calculation
certainly
and that which is opposed to them is one of the inferior principles of the soul
no doubt
this was the conclusion at which i was seeking to arrive when i said that painting or drawing and imitation in general when doing their own proper work are far removed from truth and the companions and friends and associates of a principle within us which is equally removed from reason and that they have no true or healthy aim
exactly
the imitative art is an inferior who marries an inferior and has inferior offspring
very true
and is this confined to the sight only or does it extend to the hearing also relating in fact to what we term poetry
probably the same would be true of poetry
do not rely i said on a probability derived from the analogy of painting but let us examine further and see whether the faculty with which poetical imitation is concerned is good or bad
by all means
we may state the question thus imitation imitates the actions of men whether voluntary or involuntary on which as they imagine a good or bad result has ensued and they rejoice or sorrow accordingly
is there anything more
no there is nothing else
but in all this variety of circumstances is the man at unity with himself or rather as in the instance of sight there was confusion and opposition in his opinions about the same things so here also is there not strife and inconsistency in his life
though i need hardly raise the question again for i remember that all this has been already admitted and the soul has been acknowledged by us to be full of these and ten thousand similar oppositions occurring at the same moment
and we were right he said
yes i said thus far we were right but there was an omission which must now be supplied
what was the omission
were we not saying that a good man who has the misfortune to lose his son or anything else which is most dear to him will bear the loss with more equanimity than another
yes
but will he have no sorrow or shall we say that although he cannot help sorrowing he will moderate his sorrow
the latter he said is the truer statement
tell me will he be more likely to struggle and hold out against his sorrow when he is seen by his equals or when he is alone
it will make a great difference whether he is seen or not
when he is by himself he will not mind saying or doing many things which he would be ashamed of any one hearing or seeing him do
true
there is a principle of law and reason in him which bids him resist as well as a feeling of his misfortune which is forcing him to indulge his sorrow
true
but when a man is drawn in two opposite directions to and from the same object this as we affirm necessarily implies two distinct principles in him
certainly
one of them is ready to follow the guidance of the law
how do you mean
the law would say that to be patient under suffering is best and that we should not give way to impatience as there is no knowing whether such things are good or evil and nothing is gained by impatience also because no human thing is of serious importance and grief stands in the way of that which at the moment is most required
what is most required
he asked
that we should take counsel about what has happened and when the dice have been thrown order our affairs in the way which reason deems best not like children who have had a fall keeping hold of the part struck and wasting time in setting up a howl but always accustoming the soul forthwith to apply a remedy raising up that which is sickly and fallen banishing the cry of sorrow by the healing art
yes he said that is the true way of meeting the attacks of fortune
yes i said and the higher principle is ready to follow this suggestion of reason
clearly
and the other principle which inclines us to recollection of our troubles and to lamentation and can never have enough of them we may call irrational useless and cowardly
indeed we may
and does not the latter i mean the rebellious principle furnish a great variety of materials for imitation
whereas the wise and calm temperament being always nearly equable is not easy to imitate or to appreciate when imitated especially at a public festival when a promiscuous crowd is assembled in a theatre
for the feeling represented is one to which they are strangers
certainly
then the imitative poet who aims at being popular is not by nature made nor is his art intended to please or to affect the rational principle in the soul but he will prefer the passionate and fitful temper which is easily imitated
clearly
and now we may fairly take him and place him by the side of the painter for he is like him in two ways first inasmuch as his creations have an inferior degree of truth in this i say he is like him and he is also like him in being concerned with an inferior part of the soul and therefore we shall be right in refusing to admit him into a well ordered state because he awakens and nourishes and strengthens the feelings and impairs the reason
as in a city when the evil are permitted to have authority and the good are put out of the way so in the soul of man as we maintain the imitative poet implants an evil constitution for he indulges the irrational nature which has no discernment of greater and less but thinks the same thing at one time great and at another small he is a manufacturer of images and is very far removed from the truth
exactly
but we have not yet brought forward the heaviest count in our accusation the power which poetry has of harming even the good is surely an awful thing
yes certainly if the effect is what you say
hear and judge the best of us as i conceive when we listen to a passage of homer or one of the tragedians in which he represents some pitiful hero who is drawling out his sorrows in a long oration or weeping and smiting his breast the best of us you know delight in giving way to sympathy and are in raptures at the excellence of the poet who stirs our feelings most
yes of course i know
but when any sorrow of our own happens to us then you may observe that we pride ourselves on the opposite quality we would fain be quiet and patient this is the manly part and the other which delighted us in the recitation is now deemed to be the part of a woman
very true he said
now can we be right in praising and admiring another who is doing that which any one of us would abominate and be ashamed of in his own person
no he said that is certainly not reasonable
nay i said quite reasonable from one point of view
what point of view
if you consider i said that when in misfortune we feel a natural hunger and desire to relieve our sorrow by weeping and lamentation and that this feeling which is kept under control in our own calamities is satisfied and delighted by the poets the better nature in each of us not having been sufficiently trained by reason or habit allows the sympathetic element to break loose because the sorrow is another s and the spectator fancies that there can be no disgrace to himself in praising and pitying any one who comes telling him what a good man he is and making a fuss about his troubles he thinks that the pleasure is a gain and why should he be supercilious and lose this and the poem too
few persons ever reflect as i should imagine that from the evil of other men something of evil is communicated to themselves
and so the feeling of sorrow which has gathered strength at the sight of the misfortunes of others is with difficulty repressed in our own
how very true
and does not the same hold also of the ridiculous
there are jests which you would be ashamed to make yourself and yet on the comic stage or indeed in private when you hear them you are greatly amused by them and are not at all disgusted at their unseemliness the case of pity is repeated there is a principle in human nature which is disposed to raise a laugh and this which you once restrained by reason because you were afraid of being thought a buffoon is now let out again and having stimulated the risible faculty at the theatre you are betrayed unconsciously to yourself into playing the comic poet at home
quite true he said
and the same may be said of lust and anger and all the other affections of desire and pain and pleasure which are held to be inseparable from every action in all of them poetry feeds and waters the passions instead of drying them up she lets them rule although they ought to be controlled if mankind are ever to increase in happiness and virtue
i cannot deny it
therefore glaucon i said whenever you meet with any of the eulogists of homer declaring that he has been the educator of hellas and that he is profitable for education and for the ordering of human things and that you should take him up again and again and get to know him and regulate your whole life according to him we may love and honour those who say these things they are excellent people as far as their lights extend and we are ready to acknowledge that homer is the greatest of poets and first of tragedy writers but we must remain firm in our conviction that hymns to the gods and praises of famous men are the only poetry which ought to be admitted into our state
for if you go beyond this and allow the honeyed muse to enter either in epic or lyric verse not law and the reason of mankind which by common consent have ever been deemed best but pleasure and pain will be the rulers in our state
that is most true he said
and now since we have reverted to the subject of poetry let this our defence serve to show the reasonableness of our former judgment in sending away out of our state an art having the tendencies which we have described for reason constrained us
but that she may not impute to us any harshness or want of politeness let us tell her that there is an ancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry of which there are many proofs such as the saying of the yelping hound howling at her lord or of one mighty in the vain talk of fools and the mob of sages circumventing zeus and the subtle thinkers who are beggars after all and there are innumerable other signs of ancient enmity between them
notwithstanding this let us assure our sweet friend and the sister arts of imitation that if she will only prove her title to exist in a well ordered state we shall be delighted to receive her we are very conscious of her charms but we may not on that account betray the truth
i dare say glaucon that you are as much charmed by her as i am especially when she appears in homer
yes indeed i am greatly charmed
shall i propose then that she be allowed to return from exile but upon this condition only that she make a defence of herself in lyrical or some other metre
certainly
and we may further grant to those of her defenders who are lovers of poetry and yet not poets the permission to speak in prose on her behalf let them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful to states and to human life and we will listen in a kindly spirit for if this can be proved we shall surely be the gainers i mean if there is a use in poetry as well as a delight
certainly he said we shall be the gainers
if her defence fails then my dear friend like other persons who are enamoured of something but put a restraint upon themselves when they think their desires are opposed to their interests so too must we after the manner of lovers give her up though not without a struggle
we too are inspired by that love of poetry which the education of noble states has implanted in us and therefore we would have her appear at her best and truest but so long as she is unable to make good her defence this argument of ours shall be a charm to us which we will repeat to ourselves while we listen to her strains that we may not fall away into the childish love of her which captivates the many
at all events we are well aware that poetry being such as we have described is not to be regarded seriously as attaining to the truth and he who listens to her fearing for the safety of the city which is within him should be on his guard against her seductions and make our words his law
yes he said i quite agree with you
yes i said my dear glaucon for great is the issue at stake greater than appears whether a man is to be good or bad
and what will any one be profited if under the influence of honour or money or power aye or under the excitement of poetry he neglect justice and virtue
yes he said i have been convinced by the argument as i believe that any one else would have been
and yet no mention has been made of the greatest prizes and rewards which await virtue
what are there any greater still
if there are they must be of an inconceivable greatness
why i said what was ever great in a short time
the whole period of three score years and ten is surely but a little thing in comparison with eternity
say rather nothing he replied
and should an immortal being seriously think of this little space rather than of the whole
of the whole certainly
but why do you ask
are you not aware i said that the soul of man is immortal and imperishable
he looked at me in astonishment and said no by heaven and are you really prepared to maintain this
yes i said i ought to be and you too there is no difficulty in proving it
i see a great difficulty but i should like to hear you state this argument of which you make so light
listen then
i am attending
there is a thing which you call good and another which you call evil
yes he replied
would you agree with me in thinking that the corrupting and destroying element is the evil and the saving and improving element the good
yes
and you admit that every thing has a good and also an evil as ophthalmia is the evil of the eyes and disease of the whole body as mildew is of corn and rot of timber or rust of copper and iron in everything or in almost everything there is an inherent evil and disease
yes he said
and anything which is infected by any of these evils is made evil and at last wholly dissolves and dies
true
the vice and evil which is inherent in each is the destruction of each and if this does not destroy them there is nothing else that will for good certainly will not destroy them nor again that which is neither good nor evil
certainly not
if then we find any nature which having this inherent corruption cannot be dissolved or destroyed we may be certain that of such a nature there is no destruction
that may be assumed
well i said and is there no evil which corrupts the soul
yes he said there are all the evils which we were just now passing in review unrighteousness intemperance cowardice ignorance
but does any of these dissolve or destroy her
and here do not let us fall into the error of supposing that the unjust and foolish man when he is detected perishes through his own injustice which is an evil of the soul
take the analogy of the body the evil of the body is a disease which wastes and reduces and annihilates the body and all the things of which we were just now speaking come to annihilation through their own corruption attaching to them and inhering in them and so destroying them
is not this true
yes
consider the soul in like manner
does the injustice or other evil which exists in the soul waste and consume her
do they by attaching to the soul and inhering in her at last bring her to death and so separate her from the body
certainly not
and yet i said it is unreasonable to suppose that anything can perish from without through affection of external evil which could not be destroyed from within by a corruption of its own
it is he replied
consider i said glaucon that even the badness of food whether staleness decomposition or any other bad quality when confined to the actual food is not supposed to destroy the body although if the badness of food communicates corruption to the body then we should say that the body has been destroyed by a corruption of itself which is disease brought on by this but that the body being one thing can be destroyed by the badness of food which is another and which does not engender any natural infection this we shall absolutely deny
very true
and on the same principle unless some bodily evil can produce an evil of the soul we must not suppose that the soul which is one thing can be dissolved by any merely external evil which belongs to another
yes he said there is reason in that
either then let us refute this conclusion or while it remains unrefuted let us never say that fever or any other disease or the knife put to the throat or even the cutting up of the whole body into the minutest pieces can destroy the soul until she herself is proved to become more unholy or unrighteous in consequence of these things being done to the body but that the soul or anything else if not destroyed by an internal evil can be destroyed by an external one is not to be affirmed by any man
and surely he replied no one will ever prove that the souls of men become more unjust in consequence of death
but if some one who would rather not admit the immortality of the soul boldly denies this and says that the dying do really become more evil and unrighteous then if the speaker is right i suppose that injustice like disease must be assumed to be fatal to the unjust and that those who take this disorder die by the natural inherent power of destruction which evil has and which kills them sooner or later but in quite another way from that in which at present the wicked receive death at the hands of others as the penalty of their deeds
nay he said in that case injustice if fatal to the unjust will not be so very terrible to him for he will be delivered from evil
but i rather suspect the opposite to be the truth and that injustice which if it have the power will murder others keeps the murderer alive aye and well awake too so far removed is her dwelling place from being a house of death
true i said if the inherent natural vice or evil of the soul is unable to kill or destroy her hardly will that which is appointed to be the destruction of some other body destroy a soul or anything else except that of which it was appointed to be the destruction
yes that can hardly be
but the soul which cannot be destroyed by an evil whether inherent or external must exist for ever and if existing for ever must be immortal
certainly
that is the conclusion i said and if a true conclusion then the souls must always be the same for if none be destroyed they will not diminish in number
neither will they increase for the increase of the immortal natures must come from something mortal and all things would thus end in immortality
very true
but this we cannot believe reason will not allow us any more than we can believe the soul in her truest nature to be full of variety and difference and dissimilarity
what do you mean
he said
the soul i said being as is now proven immortal must be the fairest of compositions and cannot be compounded of many elements
certainly not
her immortality is demonstrated by the previous argument and there are many other proofs but to see her as she really is not as we now behold her marred by communion with the body and other miseries you must contemplate her with the eye of reason in her original purity and then her beauty will be revealed and justice and injustice and all the things which we have described will be manifested more clearly
thus far we have spoken the truth concerning her as she appears at present but we must remember also that we have seen her only in a condition which may be compared to that of the sea god glaucus whose original image can hardly be discerned because his natural members are broken off and crushed and damaged by the waves in all sorts of ways and incrustations have grown over them of seaweed and shells and stones so that he is more like some monster than he is to his own natural form
and the soul which we behold is in a similar condition disfigured by ten thousand ills
but not there glaucon not there must we look
where then
at her love of wisdom
let us see whom she affects and what society and converse she seeks in virtue of her near kindred with the immortal and eternal and divine also how different she would become if wholly following this superior principle and borne by a divine impulse out of the ocean in which she now is and disengaged from the stones and shells and things of earth and rock which in wild variety spring up around her because she feeds upon earth and is overgrown by the good things of this life as they are termed then you would see her as she is and know whether she have one shape only or many or what her nature is
of her affections and of the forms which she takes in this present life i think that we have now said enough
true he replied
and thus i said we have fulfilled the conditions of the argument we have not introduced the rewards and glories of justice which as you were saying are to be found in homer and hesiod but justice in her own nature has been shown to be best for the soul in her own nature
let a man do what is just whether he have the ring of gyges or not and even if in addition to the ring of gyges he put on the helmet of hades
very true
and now glaucon there will be no harm in further enumerating how many and how great are the rewards which justice and the other virtues procure to the soul from gods and men both in life and after death
certainly not he said
will you repay me then what you borrowed in the argument
what did i borrow
the assumption that the just man should appear unjust and the unjust just for you were of opinion that even if the true state of the case could not possibly escape the eyes of gods and men still this admission ought to be made for the sake of the argument in order that pure justice might be weighed against pure injustice
do you remember
i should be much to blame if i had forgotten
then as the cause is decided i demand on behalf of justice that the estimation in which she is held by gods and men and which we acknowledge to be her due should now be restored to her by us since she has been shown to confer reality and not to deceive those who truly possess her let what has been taken from her be given back that so she may win that palm of appearance which is hers also and which she gives to her own
the demand he said is just
in the first place i said and this is the first thing which you will have to give back the nature both of the just and unjust is truly known to the gods
granted
and if they are both known to them one must be the friend and the other the enemy of the gods as we admitted from the beginning
true
and the friend of the gods may be supposed to receive from them all things at their best excepting only such evil as is the necessary consequence of former sins
certainly
then this must be our notion of the just man that even when he is in poverty or sickness or any other seeming misfortune all things will in the end work together for good to him in life and death for the gods have a care of any one whose desire is to become just and to be like god as far as man can attain the divine likeness by the pursuit of virtue
yes he said if he is like god he will surely not be neglected by him
and of the unjust may not the opposite be supposed
certainly
such then are the palms of victory which the gods give the just
that is my conviction
and what do they receive of men
look at things as they really are and you will see that the clever unjust are in the case of runners who run well from the starting place to the goal but not back again from the goal they go off at a great pace but in the end only look foolish slinking away with their ears draggling on their shoulders and without a crown but the true runner comes to the finish and receives the prize and is crowned
and this is the way with the just he who endures to the end of every action and occasion of his entire life has a good report and carries off the prize which men have to bestow
true
and now you must allow me to repeat of the just the blessings which you were attributing to the fortunate unjust
i shall say of them what you were saying of the others that as they grow older they become rulers in their own city if they care to be they marry whom they like and give in marriage to whom they will all that you said of the others i now say of these
and on the other hand of the unjust i say that the greater number even though they escape in their youth are found out at last and look foolish at the end of their course and when they come to be old and miserable are flouted alike by stranger and citizen they are beaten and then come those things unfit for ears polite as you truly term them they will be racked and have their eyes burned out as you were saying
and you may suppose that i have repeated the remainder of your tale of horrors
but will you let me assume without reciting them that these things are true
certainly he said what you say is true
these then are the prizes and rewards and gifts which are bestowed upon the just by gods and men in this present life in addition to the other good things which justice of herself provides
yes he said and they are fair and lasting
and yet i said all these are as nothing either in number or greatness in comparison with those other recompenses which await both just and unjust after death
and you ought to hear them and then both just and unjust will have received from us a full payment of the debt which the argument owes to them
speak he said there are few things which i would more gladly hear
well i said i will tell you a tale not one of the tales which odysseus tells to the hero alcinous yet this too is a tale of a hero er the son of armenius a pamphylian by birth
he was slain in battle and ten days afterwards when the bodies of the dead were taken up already in a state of corruption his body was found unaffected by decay and carried away home to be buried
and on the twelfth day as he was lying on the funeral pile he returned to life and told them what he had seen in the other world
he said that when his soul left the body he went on a journey with a great company and that they came to a mysterious place at which there were two openings in the earth they were near together and over against them were two other openings in the heaven above
in the intermediate space there were judges seated who commanded the just after they had given judgment on them and had bound their sentences in front of them to ascend by the heavenly way on the right hand and in like manner the unjust were bidden by them to descend by the lower way on the left hand these also bore the symbols of their deeds but fastened on their backs
he drew near and they told him that he was to be the messenger who would carry the report of the other world to men and they bade him hear and see all that was to be heard and seen in that place
then he beheld and saw on one side the souls departing at either opening of heaven and earth when sentence had been given on them and at the two other openings other souls some ascending out of the earth dusty and worn with travel some descending out of heaven clean and bright
and arriving ever and anon they seemed to have come from a long journey and they went forth with gladness into the meadow where they encamped as at a festival and those who knew one another embraced and conversed the souls which came from earth curiously enquiring about the things above and the souls which came from heaven about the things beneath
and they told one another of what had happened by the way those from below weeping and sorrowing at the remembrance of the things which they had endured and seen in their journey beneath the earth while those from above were describing heavenly delights and visions of inconceivable beauty
the story glaucon would take too long to tell but the sum was this he said that for every wrong which they had done to any one they suffered tenfold or once in a hundred years such being reckoned to be the length of man s life and the penalty being thus paid ten times in a thousand years
if for example there were any who had been the cause of many deaths or had betrayed or enslaved cities or armies or been guilty of any other evil behaviour for each and all of their offences they received punishment ten times over and the rewards of beneficence and justice and holiness were in the same proportion
i need hardly repeat what he said concerning young children dying almost as soon as they were born
of piety and impiety to gods and parents and of murderers there were retributions other and greater far which he described
he mentioned that he was present when one of the spirits asked another where is ardiaeus the great
the answer of the other spirit was he comes not hither and will never come
and this said he was one of the dreadful sights which we ourselves witnessed
we were at the mouth of the cavern and having completed all our experiences were about to reascend when of a sudden ardiaeus appeared and several others most of whom were tyrants and there were also besides the tyrants private individuals who had been great criminals they were just as they fancied about to return into the upper world but the mouth instead of admitting them gave a roar whenever any of these incurable sinners or some one who had not been sufficiently punished tried to ascend and then wild men of fiery aspect who were standing by and heard the sound seized and carried them off and ardiaeus and others they bound head and foot and hand and threw them down and flayed them with scourges and dragged them along the road at the side carding them on thorns like wool and declaring to the passers by what were their crimes and that they were being taken away to be cast into hell
and of all the many terrors which they had endured he said that there was none like the terror which each of them felt at that moment lest they should hear the voice and when there was silence one by one they ascended with exceeding joy
these said er were the penalties and retributions and there were blessings as great
now when the spirits which were in the meadow had tarried seven days on the eighth they were obliged to proceed on their journey and on the fourth day after he said that they came to a place where they could see from above a line of light straight as a column extending right through the whole heaven and through the earth in colour resembling the rainbow only brighter and purer another day s journey brought them to the place and there in the midst of the light they saw the ends of the chains of heaven let down from above for this light is the belt of heaven and holds together the circle of the universe like the under girders of a trireme
from these ends is extended the spindle of necessity on which all the revolutions turn
the shaft and hook of this spindle are made of steel and the whorl is made partly of steel and also partly of other materials
now the whorl is in form like the whorl used on earth and the description of it implied that there is one large hollow whorl which is quite scooped out and into this is fitted another lesser one and another and another and four others making eight in all like vessels which fit into one another the whorls show their edges on the upper side and on their lower side all together form one continuous whorl
this is pierced by the spindle which is driven home through the centre of the eighth
the first and outermost whorl has the rim broadest and the seven inner whorls are narrower in the following proportions the sixth is next to the first in size the fourth next to the sixth then comes the eighth the seventh is fifth the fifth is sixth the third is seventh last and eighth comes the second
the largest is spangled and the seventh is brightest the eighth coloured by the reflected light of the seventh the second and fifth are in colour like one another and yellower than the preceding the third has the whitest light the fourth is reddish the sixth is in whiteness second
now the whole spindle has the same motion but as the whole revolves in one direction the seven inner circles move slowly in the other and of these the swiftest is the eighth next in swiftness are the seventh sixth and fifth which move together third in swiftness appeared to move according to the law of this reversed motion the fourth the third appeared fourth and the second fifth
the spindle turns on the knees of necessity and on the upper surface of each circle is a siren who goes round with them hymning a single tone or note
the eight together form one harmony and round about at equal intervals there is another band three in number each sitting upon her throne these are the fates daughters of necessity who are clothed in white robes and have chaplets upon their heads lachesis and clotho and atropos who accompany with their voices the harmony of the sirens lachesis singing of the past clotho of the present atropos of the future clotho from time to time assisting with a touch of her right hand the revolution of the outer circle of the whorl or spindle and atropos with her left hand touching and guiding the inner ones and lachesis laying hold of either in turn first with one hand and then with the other
when er and the spirits arrived their duty was to go at once to lachesis but first of all there came a prophet who arranged them in order then he took from the knees of lachesis lots and samples of lives and having mounted a high pulpit spoke as follows hear the word of lachesis the daughter of necessity
mortal souls behold a new cycle of life and mortality
your genius will not be allotted to you but you will choose your genius and let him who draws the first lot have the first choice and the life which he chooses shall be his destiny
virtue is free and as a man honours or dishonours her he will have more or less of her the responsibility is with the chooser god is justified
when the interpreter had thus spoken he scattered lots indifferently among them all and each of them took up the lot which fell near him all but er himself and each as he took his lot perceived the number which he had obtained
then the interpreter placed on the ground before them the samples of lives and there were many more lives than the souls present and they were of all sorts
there were lives of every animal and of man in every condition
and there were tyrannies among them some lasting out the tyrant s life others which broke off in the middle and came to an end in poverty and exile and beggary and there were lives of famous men some who were famous for their form and beauty as well as for their strength and success in games or again for their birth and the qualities of their ancestors and some who were the reverse of famous for the opposite qualities
and of women likewise there was not however any definite character in them because the soul when choosing a new life must of necessity become different
but there was every other quality and the all mingled with one another and also with elements of wealth and poverty and disease and health and there were mean states also
and here my dear glaucon is the supreme peril of our human state and therefore the utmost care should be taken
let each one of us leave every other kind of knowledge and seek and follow one thing only if peradventure he may be able to learn and may find some one who will make him able to learn and discern between good and evil and so to choose always and everywhere the better life as he has opportunity
he should consider the bearing of all these things which have been mentioned severally and collectively upon virtue he should know what the effect of beauty is when combined with poverty or wealth in a particular soul and what are the good and evil consequences of noble and humble birth of private and public station of strength and weakness of cleverness and dullness and of all the natural and acquired gifts of the soul and the operation of them when conjoined he will then look at the nature of the soul and from the consideration of all these qualities he will be able to determine which is the better and which is the worse and so he will choose giving the name of evil to the life which will make his soul more unjust and good to the life which will make his soul more just all else he will disregard
for we have seen and know that this is the best choice both in life and after death
a man must take with him into the world below an adamantine faith in truth and right that there too he may be undazzled by the desire of wealth or the other allurements of evil lest coming upon tyrannies and similar villainies he do irremediable wrongs to others and suffer yet worse himself but let him know how to choose the mean and avoid the extremes on either side as far as possible not only in this life but in all that which is to come
for this is the way of happiness
and according to the report of the messenger from the other world this was what the prophet said at the time even for the last comer if he chooses wisely and will live diligently there is appointed a happy and not undesirable existence
let not him who chooses first be careless and let not the last despair
and when he had spoken he who had the first choice came forward and in a moment chose the greatest tyranny his mind having been darkened by folly and sensuality he had not thought out the whole matter before he chose and did not at first sight perceive that he was fated among other evils to devour his own children
but when he had time to reflect and saw what was in the lot he began to beat his breast and lament over his choice forgetting the proclamation of the prophet for instead of throwing the blame of his misfortune on himself he accused chance and the gods and everything rather than himself
now he was one of those who came from heaven and in a former life had dwelt in a well ordered state but his virtue was a matter of habit only and he had no philosophy
and it was true of others who were similarly overtaken that the greater number of them came from heaven and therefore they had never been schooled by trial whereas the pilgrims who came from earth having themselves suffered and seen others suffer were not in a hurry to choose
and owing to this inexperience of theirs and also because the lot was a chance many of the souls exchanged a good destiny for an evil or an evil for a good
for if a man had always on his arrival in this world dedicated himself from the first to sound philosophy and had been moderately fortunate in the number of the lot he might as the messenger reported be happy here and also his journey to another life and return to this instead of being rough and underground would be smooth and heavenly
most curious he said was the spectacle sad and laughable and strange for the choice of the souls was in most cases based on their experience of a previous life
there he saw the soul which had once been orpheus choosing the life of a swan out of enmity to the race of women hating to be born of a woman because they had been his murderers he beheld also the soul of thamyras choosing the life of a nightingale birds on the other hand like the swan and other musicians wanting to be men
the soul which obtained the twentieth lot chose the life of a lion and this was the soul of ajax the son of telamon who would not be a man remembering the injustice which was done him in the judgment about the arms
the next was agamemnon who took the life of an eagle because like ajax he hated human nature by reason of his sufferings
about the middle came the lot of atalanta she seeing the great fame of an athlete was unable to resist the temptation and after her there followed the soul of epeus the son of panopeus passing into the nature of a woman cunning in the arts and far away among the last who chose the soul of the jester thersites was putting on the form of a monkey
there came also the soul of odysseus having yet to make a choice and his lot happened to be the last of them all
now the recollection of former toils had disenchanted him of ambition and he went about for a considerable time in search of the life of a private man who had no cares he had some difficulty in finding this which was lying about and had been neglected by everybody else and when he saw it he said that he would have done the same had his lot been first instead of last and that he was delighted to have it
and not only did men pass into animals but i must also mention that there were animals tame and wild who changed into one another and into corresponding human natures the good into the gentle and the evil into the savage in all sorts of combinations
all the souls had now chosen their lives and they went in the order of their choice to lachesis who sent with them the genius whom they had severally chosen to be the guardian of their lives and the fulfiller of the choice this genius led the souls first to clotho and drew them within the revolution of the spindle impelled by her hand thus ratifying the destiny of each and then when they were fastened to this carried them to atropos who spun the threads and made them irreversible whence without turning round they passed beneath the throne of necessity and when they had all passed they marched on in a scorching heat to the plain of forgetfulness which was a barren waste destitute of trees and verdure and then towards evening they encamped by the river of unmindfulness whose water no vessel can hold of this they were all obliged to drink a certain quantity and those who were not saved by wisdom drank more than was necessary and each one as he drank forgot all things
now after they had gone to rest about the middle of the night there was a thunderstorm and earthquake and then in an instant they were driven upwards in all manner of ways to their birth like stars shooting
he himself was hindered from drinking the water
but in what manner or by what means he returned to the body he could not say only in the morning awaking suddenly he found himself lying on the pyre
and thus glaucon the tale has been saved and has not perished and will save us if we are obedient to the word spoken and we shall pass safely over the river of forgetfulness and our soul will not be defiled
wherefore my counsel is that we hold fast ever to the heavenly way and follow after justice and virtue always considering that the soul is immortal and able to endure every sort of good and every sort of evil
thus shall we live dear to one another and to the gods both while remaining here and when like conquerors in the games who go round to gather gifts we receive our reward
and it shall be well with us both in this life and in the pilgrimage of a thousand years which we have been describing

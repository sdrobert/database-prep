Like Katz, we're comparing our implementation to someone else's on
Plato's Republic (see setup details in ../katz/README).

We're comparing against KenLM. KenLM treats each line as a sentence, adds
<s> and </s> to the beginning and and (even if the line is blank). KenLM adds
<unk>

To get the model:

bin/lmplz --text republic.txt --order 3 --arpa republic.arpa

To get the model that prunes bigrams and trigrams of count 1:

bin/lmplz --text republic.txt --order 3 --prune 0 1 1 --arpa republic.pruned.arpa
